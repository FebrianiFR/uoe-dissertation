Well for one, this will surely be the speed of planetary rotation and the wind
speeds your atmosphere can generate in North-South-direction.  
In my understanding those cells form as N-S winds flow and become deflected
from this direction. So the number of cells will be determined by the winds
that start either at the equator or the pole and the distance that they can
cover before being deflected into completely zonal direction.

To have a rough idea about this distance I tried to estimate this (in a very
quick, dirty and most likely extremely wrong way) by assuming the simplified
Navier-Stokes equation in planetary coordinates on synoptic scales:  
$$\partial_t \vec v = 2 \Omega \sin\Theta (\vec v \times \vec z),$$  
where  $\Theta$  is the planetary latitude,  $\Omega=\Omega(\Theta)$  the
local planetary rotation frequency at the given latitude and  $v_0$  the local
wind speed, leading to a harmonic equation for the meridional speed  
$$\partial_{tt} v_{\phi} = -(2\Omega \sin\Theta)^2 v_{\phi},$$  which with the
usual arguments of scale-analysis gives us a timescale  $\tau_{\phi}$  for the
periodic movement involved in solutions of that equation, of  
$$\tau_{\phi} \sim \frac{1}{2\Omega \sin\Theta}$$  
corresponding to a distance  $$ d \sim \frac{v_0}{2\Omega \sin\Theta_0}$$
covered by the vortex. Of course, I cheated here by assuming the initial speed
$v_0 = \text{const}$  and the initial Coriolis-factor constant with  $\Theta =
\Theta_0$  .  
As now such a ""structure"" (solution of the above eqs.) will have a size of
$2d$  in the meridional direction, having space of  $\pi R_{\text{planet}}$
our number of Hadley cells per hemisphere becomes simply  $$N = \frac{\pi
R_{\text{planet}} \Omega \sin\Theta_0}{v_0}$$  
Where we'd need to estimate this number starting at the poles, as the
Coriolis-parameter vanishes at the equator.

I will later (if I don't forget it) pluck in some numbers and see how bad this
estimate is, or perhaps someone can try that. Anyway, I'm open for
improvements of those arguments from anyone who knows something, but a quick
look into Holton, _An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology_ , unfortunately
didn't reveal much.

But to also address your question a little bit further: Of course, we'd need
to have some climatic model to be able to estimate  $v_0$  and know the speed
of planetary rotation. Independent of how bad my formula is, the initial
arguments of deflection vs. 'climbing the meridian' should hold for the
formation of a Hadley cell.  
Returning winds from higher atmospheric layers, surface friction in the
atmospheric boundary layer will also play a role for an exact calculation.

jets. Also turbulent eddies can provide a good mechanism for justifying a
locally constant  $v_0$  , that I simply assumed in my calculation above.

I wanted to note one other thing that seems important to me (and is perhaps
also to anyone on this planet..):  
While this rule of thumb-calculations can work out, there is more physics that
play a role in shaping the exact morphology of circulation-cells on a planet.
Namely the radiative equilibrium in the atmosphere, which links the exact
positions of those cells to a changing climate.

As a [ study
](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n1/full/ngeo.2007.38.html) suggests by
measuring Tropical to Polar-Jet distances and Tropopause heights, those cells
can expand and reshape the environment people live in.","The number and structure of atmospheric circulation cells on a planet—such as Earth's three-cell (Hadley, Ferrel, Polar) system per hemisphere, Jupiter's multiple jet streams, or Titan's single global cell—are primarily determined by planetary rotation rate (angular velocity), planetary radius, atmospheric composition and mass, incident solar insolation (latitudinal energy gradient), and the efficiency of meridional heat transport. Rapid planetary rotation increases the Coriolis effect, fragmenting large Hadley-like cells into multiple zonal jets and smaller cells, as seen on gas giants, while slow rotation or tidal locking favors fewer, broader cells, sometimes resulting in a single global overturning cell. The Rossby deformation radius, which scales with atmospheric static stability and rotation rate, sets the characteristic width of circulation cells, while the thermal Rossby number quantifies the balance between buoyancy-driven and rotationally constrained flows, influencing cell number and extent. Atmospheric thickness, specific heat capacity, and radiative timescales modulate the vertical and horizontal extent of circulation, while surface features (topography, land-ocean distribution) and obliquity can further modify cell structure. To estimate the number of atmospheric circulation cells on a hypothetical planet, one would require knowledge of its rotation period, radius, atmospheric scale height and composition, incident stellar flux, and surface boundary conditions, integrating these parameters into dynamical models governed by the primitive equations of geophysical fluid dynamics.","The number and structure of atmospheric circulation cells on a planet are fundamentally governed by the interplay of planetary rotation rate (angular velocity), planetary radius, atmospheric thickness and composition, insolation gradient (latitudinal differential heating), and the presence or absence of surface features such as continents or oceans. On Earth, the Coriolis effect—arising from moderate rotation and planetary size—divides the meridional overturning circulation into three distinct cells per hemisphere: the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, each characterized by alternating zones of rising and subsiding air and associated surface wind belts. Gas giants like Jupiter, with rapid rotation rates and large radii, exhibit a much stronger Coriolis force, resulting in a greater number of narrower, latitudinally confined zonal jets and multiple alternating cyclonic and anticyclonic bands, effectively fragmenting the global circulation into many more cells. In contrast, a slow-rotating or tidally locked planet, or a body with a thick, homogeneous atmosphere and minimal Coriolis deflection, such as Titan, may exhibit a single, planet-wide Hadley-type cell spanning from equator to pole, as the weak Coriolis force fails to break up the meridional overturning. To estimate the number of atmospheric cells on a hypothetical planet, one would require knowledge of its rotation rate, planetary radius, atmospheric scale height and composition, incident solar flux distribution, and surface boundary conditions, as these parameters collectively determine the Rossby number, the strength of the Coriolis effect, and the resulting dynamical regime of atmospheric circulation."

![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/Z3EMC.jpg)","Tropical cyclones are virtually absent from the South Atlantic Ocean due to a combination of unfavorable environmental conditions, including strong vertical wind shear, relatively cool sea surface temperatures, lack of a pronounced Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and limited pre-existing atmospheric disturbances such as African easterly waves, which are crucial for cyclone genesis in other basins. The Coriolis effect, necessary for cyclone spin-up, is present but insufficient to overcome these inhibiting factors, and the South Atlantic subtropical high further stabilizes the atmosphere, suppressing convection and cyclone development. In contrast, the North Atlantic, western North Pacific, and parts of the South Pacific near Australia exhibit more favorable conditions, such as warmer waters, lower wind shear, and frequent tropical disturbances, supporting frequent cyclone formation. The rare exceptions in the South Atlantic, such as Hurricane Catarina in 2004 and a handful of subtropical storms, underscore the exceptional nature of such events and highlight the basin's general resistance to tropical cyclone activity. This paucity of cyclogenesis in the South Atlantic is a well-documented climatological anomaly, distinguishing it from other tropical ocean basins where cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons are common.","The conspicuous paucity of tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic basin is attributable to a confluence of unfavorable atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, including persistently cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) typically below the 26.5°C threshold necessary for sustained deep convection and cyclogenesis, as well as strong vertical wind shear associated with the subtropical jet stream, which disrupts the vertical alignment of developing tropical disturbances. Additionally, the South Atlantic lacks a robust Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and experiences minimal African easterly wave activity, both of which are critical for the genesis of tropical cyclones in other ocean basins. The prevailing South Atlantic subtropical high-pressure system further suppresses convective activity and inhibits the formation of low-level vorticity, while the absence of significant Coriolis force near the equator limits the initial spin-up of cyclonic systems. In contrast, the North Atlantic, western North Pacific, and southwestern Indian Ocean exhibit more favorable thermodynamic and dynamic environments, including higher SSTs, lower vertical wind shear, and more frequent pre-existing disturbances, facilitating prolific tropical cyclone activity. Rare exceptions, such as Hurricane Catarina in 2004, underscore the anomalous nature of South Atlantic tropical cyclogenesis, typically requiring transient, highly unusual synoptic-scale conditions that momentarily overcome the region’s otherwise prohibitive environmental constraints."

First of all I will try to explain what a geomagnetic pole reversal is.

A magnetic pole reversal happens when the magnetic field weakens until it can
no longer sustain itself. This can take 1000-3000 Years or more to complete
the time it takes is very variable.

After years with a weak and sometimes variable magnetic field. The magnetic
field re emerges in its original, or in a changed direction. So it is not the
poles moving over the surface of earth.

Link [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal)

What happens during a geomagnetic pole reversal.

During a pole reversal earths magnetic field is weak so our planet is less
protected from cosmic radiation and from the solar wind.

Link [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field)

This increase in cosmic radiation does not fit any of the known extinction
events that have happened in Earth's history. This does not mean nothing at
all will happen to life during this time it only means the dangers are low.

If you want to follow how the cosmic radiation changes you can do this on the

I mentioned in my comment Earth's magnetic north pole is really in the south.
To understand how this can be true in a magnetic compass the magnetic north
pole is repelled by Earth's north pole so it does point in the opposite
direction (a bad explanation but it is how it works).","Geomagnetic reversals, or magnetic pole flips, are phenomena wherein Earth's magnetic field gradually weakens, becomes disordered, and ultimately reverses polarity, a process driven by turbulent convection and dynamo action in the liquid outer core, but the solid inner core does not physically flip. The duration of a magnetic reversal varies widely, typically spanning 1,000 to 10,000 years, with transitional periods marked by complex, multipolar field configurations and significant geomagnetic excursions, during which the geomagnetic field intensity can drop to as low as 10% of its normal strength. Environmental consequences of a geomagnetic reversal may include increased cosmic and solar radiation at Earth's surface due to a weakened magnetosphere, potential impacts on atmospheric chemistry (such as ozone depletion), and disruptions to animal navigation systems that rely on geomagnetic cues, though there is no evidence of mass extinctions directly linked to past reversals. The geomagnetic poles are currently migrating at variable rates (the North Magnetic Pole has accelerated to over 50 km per year), but there is no definitive predictive marker for when a full reversal or rapid acceleration will occur, as secular variation is a normal aspect of the geodynamo process. During a reversal or rapid geomagnetic shift, compass needles would become unreliable, potentially pointing in anomalous directions or exhibiting erratic behavior as the field becomes disordered and multiple poles may temporarily exist at Earth's surface.","Geomagnetic reversals, or magnetic pole flips, are stochastic geophysical phenomena wherein the Earth's geomagnetic field gradually weakens, becomes multipolar, and ultimately reverses polarity, a process typically unfolding over 1,000 to 10,000 years, though paleomagnetic records indicate durations ranging from a few centuries to tens of millennia. During a reversal, the geodynamo processes in the fluid outer core, driven by thermochemical convection and the Coriolis effect, do not entail a physical inversion or ""flipping"" of the solid inner core or the entire core structure; rather, the convective flow patterns and resultant magnetic field orientation reorganize, causing the dipole axis to wander and sometimes fragment into complex, non-dipolar configurations. Environmental consequences of geomagnetic reversals primarily involve a transient reduction in field intensity, leading to diminished magnetospheric shielding and increased flux of galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles to the atmosphere, potentially enhancing atmospheric ionization, ozone depletion, and minor perturbations to biota and climate, though no direct evidence links reversals to mass extinctions or catastrophic environmental upheaval. The current secular variation of the geomagnetic field, exemplified by the rapid drift of the North Magnetic Pole (exceeding 50 km per year in recent decades), is not necessarily indicative of an imminent reversal, as such excursions and pole movements have occurred frequently in the paleomagnetic record without culminating in full reversals. Should a reversal or rapid excursion commence, compass needles would exhibit anomalous, unpredictable behavior, deviating from geographic north, potentially pointing in variable directions depending on local field complexity, and rendering traditional navigation unreliable until the field stabilizes in its new orientation."
I have never understood why earth's inner core is solid. Considering that the inner core is made of an iron-nickel alloy (melting point around 1350 C to 1600 C) and the temperature of the inner core is approximately 5430 C (about the temperature of the surface of the sun). Since Earth's core is nearly 3-4 times the melting point of iron-nickel alloys how can it possibly be solid?,"This post tries to find out why the inner core of earth is solid. According to the temperature and pressure in the core, ",3,['N/A'],"['solid_inner_core/Phase_diagram.txt'
 'solid_inner_core/Earth%27s_inner_core.txt']","['solid_inner_core/Earth%27s_inner_core1.txt'

Earth's inner core is solid even though the temperature is so high because the
pressure is also very high. According to [ the Wikipedia article
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_core) on the Earth's inner core, the
temperature at the center is $5,700\ \text{K}$ and the pressure is estimated
to be $330$ to $360\ \text{GPa}$ ($\sim3\cdot10^{6}\ \text{atm}$).

The phase diagram shown below (taken from [ this paper
](http://www.agu.org/books/gd/v031/GD031p0083/GD031p0083.pdf) ) shows the
liquid/solid transition, where fcc and hcp are two different crystalline forms
of solid iron. You can see clearly from the slope of the line going off toward
the upper right that iron should be solid at this temperature and pressure.

![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/w82eb.png)","The solid state of Earth's inner core, despite temperatures (~5430°C) far exceeding the standard melting point of iron-nickel alloys (1350–1600°C), is explained by the immense pressure (~330–360 GPa) at the core's depth, which drastically increases the melting point of these metals through the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. At such extreme pressures, the atoms in the iron-nickel alloy are forced into a tightly packed crystalline lattice, stabilizing the solid phase even at temperatures that would induce melting at surface pressures. The phase diagram of iron demonstrates that the solid-liquid boundary (solidus) shifts to much higher temperatures as pressure increases, so the geotherm (temperature gradient with depth) intersects the solid phase at the inner core's conditions. Seismic wave studies, particularly the propagation of P-waves and the absence of S-waves in the outer core but their transmission through the inner core, provide empirical evidence for the inner core's solidity and the outer core's liquidity. This phenomenon exemplifies the interplay between temperature, pressure, and phase stability in planetary interiors, governed by thermodynamic principles and the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.","The solid state of Earth's inner core, despite its temperature exceeding the ambient melting point of iron-nickel alloys, is a consequence of extreme pressure-induced phase stability, where the geotherm intersects the solidus rather than the liquidus of the core's compositional phase diagram. At depths exceeding 5,100 kilometers, lithostatic pressures reach approximately 330–360 GPa, dramatically elevating the melting point of iron and its alloys through the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, thereby stabilizing a hexagonally close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, known as ε-iron, under core conditions. The inner core's solidification is further governed by the interplay of thermal and compositional gradients, latent heat release, and the partitioning of light elements (such as sulfur, silicon, and oxygen) during the freezing of the liquid outer core, which collectively drive the geodynamo via compositional convection. Seismic wave propagation, specifically the transmission of primary (P) waves and the attenuation of secondary (S) waves, empirically confirms the rigidity and anisotropy of the inner core, distinguishing it from the overlying fluid outer core. Thus, the paradox of a solid inner core at temperatures above the nominal melting point is resolved by recognizing the dominant role of pressure in shifting phase boundaries, resulting in a solid metallic core at the center of the Earth."

Appears that ground-to-cloud is possible, though normally only a result of a
man-made object creating ""unnatural"" electric potential, and is the least
common type of lightning.","A lightning strike consists of a stepped leader, an initial, faint, and highly branched channel of ionized air propagating downward from the cloud toward the ground in discrete steps, which establishes a conductive path by progressively lowering the electrical potential difference between the cloud and the ground. Upon the leader's approach to within tens of meters of the ground, an upward-moving return stroke, initiated by the rapid neutralization of charge as ground-based positive streamers connect with the descending leader, propagates upward at a velocity approaching one-third the speed of light, resulting in the intensely bright, high-current discharge observed as the main lightning flash. The return stroke is much brighter and faster than the stepped leader because it involves the rapid movement of a large quantity of charge along the fully ionized, low-resistance channel established by the leader, releasing energy as intense visible light, heat, and electromagnetic radiation. The stepped leader's propagation is limited by the need to repeatedly ionize new air segments, resulting in a dim, segmented appearance, whereas the return stroke traverses a pre-ionized path, allowing for a continuous, high-current flow. The brightness and speed of the return stroke are further amplified by the high electrical conductivity of the plasma channel and the sudden, large-scale equalization of electrical potential between cloud and ground, which can reach peak currents of tens of kiloamperes. This process is fundamental to the physics of lightning, involving concepts such as dielectric breakdown, plasma channel formation, streamer propagation, and the rapid release of stored electrostatic energy.","The observed phenomenon in high-speed lightning imagery, where the most intense and rapid flash propagates from the ground upward, is attributable to the return stroke phase of a cloud-to-ground lightning discharge, which follows the initial stepped leader descent. The stepped leader, a highly branched, ionized channel of negative charge, propagates toward the ground in discrete, relatively dim steps, establishing a conductive path through the atmosphere by sequentially ionizing air molecules and creating a channel of partially ionized plasma. Upon the leader’s approach to within tens of meters of the surface, an upward-moving positive streamer, or connecting leader, rises from the ground or elevated objects, completing the ionized channel and enabling a massive potential difference to be rapidly neutralized. The return stroke, characterized by a high-current, high-temperature plasma wave, travels upward at approximately one-third the speed of light, vastly outpacing the stepped leader and emitting intense optical radiation due to the rapid recombination and excitation of atmospheric gases, which accounts for its greater brightness and apparent speed. This process is governed by the physics of electrical breakdown, plasma conductivity, and radiative transfer, with the return stroke representing the principal energy dissipation event in the lightning flash, producing the majority of the visible light and electromagnetic energy observed during a lightning strike."

Short answer: humidity is not a proxy for rain starting and no, it does not
start raining automatically when 100% humidity is reached (haze or clouds can
form though). The onset of rain is dependent on many things including
humidity, but a specific value of humidity is not a sufficient condition for
rain.

Water vapor is a gas and invisible. The amount of water vapor in the air can
be expressed as relative humidity (RH) which is the ratio of water vapor
pressure ($e$) and saturation water vapor pressure ($e_s$). Saturation vapor
pressure is the partial pressure of vapor when evaporation and condensation
rates are equal, represented by RH=100%. When RH > 100% net condensation
occurs, but water has its own ideas.

In a mixture of pure dry air and water vapor, water will not condense until
around 400% RH. Reasons for this are a bit complicated but it has to do with
very small droplets being more likely to evaporate as their curvature is very
large ( [ Kelvin effect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_equation) ,
saturation vapor pressure is higher over curved surfaces than flat ones).
Luckily for us, our atmosphere is not pure air but has small particulates
suspended in it (aerosols). Some of these aerosols are classed as cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) and enable droplet formation at lower relative
humidities. These work by forming a solute in water increasing the energy
needed to break bonds and evaporate the water ( [ Raoult's_law
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoult%27s_law) )

The combined interaction of these are described by [ Köhler theory
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_theory) and describe droplet
growth in terms of drop size, solute and supersaturation (RH-100%). In a
nutshell, there is a critical drop size below which drop size decreases for
decreasing supersaturation and above which drop size _increases_ for
decreasing supersaturation. The critical supersaturation is the
supersaturation needed to attain the critical drop size, and is generally
small (e.g. 0.3% supersaturation).

Droplets below the critical size are 'haze drops' and these make up the haze
you see on very humid days. Drops that reach the critical size can continue to
grow to become cloud drops. The condensed water is carried in the air but is
no longer water vapor and is not part of relative humidity (but does
contribute to the parcel density)

So... when does it rain?

It rains when water vapor is in the presence of CCN, driven to a
supersaturation causing growth to the critical drop size (on the order of
$\mu$m) and continuing to grow to cloud drops and further to the much bigger
drop sizes that make up drizzle (100-300 $\mu$m)and rain drops(mm), a process
that takes around 40 minutes. Drops will grow until the updraft can no longer
support their mass and then they fall from the cloud as rain.

Your question asks at what humidity does it rain, but what surface humidity
determines is how high the cloud bases are. When the dew point depression (the
difference between temperature and dew point) is high, the cloud bases will be
higher than when the dew point depression is small. As air rises it cools, and
at some point 100% RH is attained. If there is forcing for vertical ascent,
parcels can rise to this height and then to a height where they freely convect
due to decreased parcel density caused by the release of energy during
condensation (see: [ CAPE
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy) ).

So far to have rain we've needed water vapor (but not at 100% at the surface),
aerosols to aid condensation (CCN) and a way to cool the air to reach 100% RH
via lifting. It is these three things -- moisture, aerosols and cooling, that
we need for a rain storm. We can have 100% RH days that are just hazy or foggy
that do not rain and we can have days with mextremely little RH (e.g. deserts)
that result in little rainstorms or large severe storms. We also have storms
we call 'elevated convection' that are completely disconnected from surface
conditions and when these storms cause rain is not related to surface humidity
at all.

If you are looking for a magic trigger for rain, your closest bet will be
looking at temperature, dew point and the height parcels need to attain to
freely convect ( [ LFC
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_free_convection) ). If there is
forcing for parcels to get that high and instability above, then rain is a
good bet. Forcing for lift can be anything from convergence along a boundary
(sea breeze, cold front, outflow from another storm), orographic lifting
(mountains, hills), thermally or dynamically forced.

To address your specific concerns:

>> Invisible to me would mean that clouds are excluded from humidity.

Correct, clouds are not part of humidity, they are suspended liquid water
drops, usually condensed onto a solute of some kind.

>

>> That again makes me think a cloud must be included.

Water vapor contributes to humidity but water vapor does not include liquid
water. Cloud water, ice, snow, rain, grapple, hail all contribute to the total
mass of a volume of air, but are not humidity.

> The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.
>

>> Rainfall certainly decreases humidity, but it is not stated at what
percentage it starts to rain.

Humidity will increase during a rainstorm as rain and puddles evaporate.
Temperature will decrease toward the wet bulb temperature. As noted in the
answer, there isn't a magic number of %humidity that causes rain to start.","Relative humidity (RH) is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in the air to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, expressed as a percentage, with 100% RH indicating saturation where air can hold no more water vapor at that temperature without condensation. Supersaturation, where RH exceeds 100%, can occur in the absence of condensation nuclei or under rapid cooling, as pure water vapor can persist above saturation due to kinetic barriers to nucleation, meaning condensation and precipitation do not occur instantaneously at RH > 100%. The onset and intensity of precipitation depend on the availability and concentration of condensation nuclei (such as dust, aerosols, or salt particles), vertical air motions, and the degree of supersaturation, which together determine the rate and size of droplet formation and growth, explaining the variability between light drizzle and heavy rain. Rainfall intensity is governed by microphysical processes such as collision-coalescence, Bergeron-Findeisen processes, and updraft strength, allowing for a range of precipitation rates even when local supersaturation is only marginally above 100%. Therefore, the limit of humidity is not strictly 100%, as supersaturation is physically possible, and the transition from vapor to liquid phase (and thus the onset and intensity of rain) is mediated by atmospheric dynamics, nucleation processes, and the microphysical environment, rather than a simple threshold exceedance.","Relative humidity (RH) quantifies the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, with 100% RH indicating saturation; however, air can become supersaturated (RH > 100%) under certain atmospheric conditions, particularly in the absence of condensation nuclei or when rapid cooling outpaces condensation processes. Supersaturation arises because condensation, the phase transition from vapor to liquid, requires not only thermodynamic saturation but also the presence of aerosol particles (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN) to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation, as homogeneous nucleation is kinetically inhibited and requires much higher supersaturation levels. Precipitation, such as rain, does not commence instantaneously at the onset of supersaturation; rather, it depends on the microphysical growth of cloud droplets through collision-coalescence or Bergeron-Findeisen processes, which are influenced by the degree of supersaturation, droplet size distribution, and vertical atmospheric dynamics. The intensity of rainfall (light versus heavy rain) is governed by the efficiency and rate of droplet growth and aggregation, updraft strength, and the availability of CCN, rather than a simple threshold exceedance of 100% RH, which explains the variability in precipitation rates despite similar saturation conditions. Thus, the limit of humidity is not strictly 100% due to kinetic and microphysical constraints, and supersaturation is a well-documented phenomenon in cloud physics, critical for understanding cloud formation, precipitation initiation, and the variability of rainfall intensity in Earth's atmosphere."
"Forgive my ignorance of the subject but I was always wondered about the exact reason of this phenomenon.

Vernal equinox happens around March 20, whereas autumnal equinox happens around September 22, so wherever you are in Northern Hemisphere, the length of the day, and consequently the amount of solar energy that reaches the place should be almost the same.

However the average temperatures differ widely, for example Toronto has average temperatures of 2°C to 6°C on March 20th, and 14°C to 19°C on September 22nd. So around 12°C difference [link].

So obviously there is some sort of temperature inertia, as temperatures seem to experience a delay in responding to changes in day length.

What is the main reason for it? Is it effect of sea ice or snow-covered land albedo? Energy stored in oceans? Energy absorbed by melting snow and ice?","The post wants to know the reason behind the fact that the March is colder in the Nothern Hemisphere. The phenomenon is called season lag.

solstices-start-of-the-season-or-mid-season/2603#2603) but the basic idea is
that temperature lags behind insolation by several weeks, because it takes
time to change the mean temperatures of the land, the atmospehere, and
especially oceans change their mean temperature. This diagram tries to show
the lag, along with various ways of reckoning the seasons:

![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/gWNb5.png)","The observed temperature lag between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, despite equivalent day length and solar insolation, is primarily attributable to the phenomenon of seasonal thermal inertia, which arises from the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of Earth's surface materials, especially the ocean's high specific heat and the latent heat involved in phase changes of snow and ice. During the months following the winter solstice, the ground, bodies of water, and atmosphere gradually absorb increasing solar energy, but much of this energy is initially expended in warming cold surfaces, melting snow and ice (latent heat of fusion), and overcoming the high albedo of snow-covered landscapes, resulting in a delayed temperature response. By contrast, after the summer solstice, accumulated heat in the land and ocean is slowly released due to their thermal mass, and the absence of widespread snow and ice means less energy is diverted to phase changes, so temperatures remain elevated well after the peak insolation has passed. Additionally, atmospheric circulation patterns, soil moisture content, and the lag in oceanic heat release further modulate the rate at which surface temperatures respond to changes in solar input, amplifying the seasonal asymmetry. This cumulative effect, often termed the ""seasonal lag,"" is most pronounced in regions with significant oceanic influence or extensive seasonal snow cover, and is a fundamental aspect of Earth's climatology and energy budget.","The pronounced temperature asymmetry between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, despite equivalent photoperiod and solar insolation, primarily arises from the phenomenon of seasonal thermal lag, a consequence of the Earth's surface and atmospheric heat capacity, particularly the high specific heat of water in oceans and lakes, which causes a delayed response in surface temperatures to changes in net radiative energy flux. During the boreal spring, terrestrial and aquatic surfaces are emerging from the thermal minimum of winter, requiring substantial energy input to overcome the latent heat of fusion associated with melting snow and ice, as well as to increase the sensible heat content of the ground and lower troposphere, processes that are further modulated by high surface albedo and reduced net shortwave absorption. In contrast, by the autumnal equinox, the Northern Hemisphere has accumulated significant thermal energy throughout the preceding months of positive net radiation, resulting in elevated land and ocean temperatures that persist due to the slow release of stored heat, even as day length and insolation decrease. The persistence of warmer temperatures in September compared to March is further reinforced by the diminished presence of snow and ice, which lowers surface albedo and enhances the absorption of solar radiation, as well as by the continued release of latent heat from water bodies and soils that have reached their annual thermal maxima. This interplay of radiative forcing, latent and sensible heat fluxes, surface albedo feedbacks, and the thermal inertia of the hydrosphere and cryosphere collectively governs the observed lag between solar forcing and atmospheric temperature response, a fundamental aspect of Earth's seasonal energy budget and climate dynamics."
"Intuitively, it makes perfect sense to think that the coldest day of the year would be the day that gets the least sunshine, the winter solstice. In the northern hemisphere, this occurs a few days before Christmas.

Primarily because of **inertia** . This phenomenon is called [ seasonal lag
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag) .

It is true that the December solstice is the moment that the northern
hemisphere gets the lowest total amount of insolation. Conversely, the June
solstice corresponds to the moment of maximum insolation. The oceans, and to a
lesser degree the land, absorb a lot of heat. Due to the large heat capacity
of water and the large amounts of water, the seasonal lag can be considerable.
In general, mid-latitude areas near large bodies of water have the largest
seasonal lag, to the extent that the warmest month of the year in most of
western Europe is August.

It is illustrated very well by this _Warmest day of the Year_ map that NOAA
NCDC (now NCEI) produced for the contiguous United States:

[ ![NCDC/NCEI map of warmest day of the year](https://i.sstatic.net/b4A5P.jpg)
](https://i.sstatic.net/b4A5P.jpg)

As expected, areas with a humid climate, such as southern Texas and nearby
areas, tend to have the warmest day of the year in August. The west coast is
even more extreme, with some places having the warmest day in September.
Conversely, desert areas in the southwest (southern Arizona, New Mexico,
western Texas) have the warmest day of the year in June. (For the Big Bend
area in Texas, it's even in the _first_ half of June, which has different
reasons; I'm no expert on the climate of the region, but according to [ a

the North American Monsoon. July and August are much cloudier (and
occasionally, much more rainy) than is June in the Big Bend area_ ). There is

The detailed structure is somewhat different, which has to due with local
climate and circulation, but the overall trend related to humidity and
proximity to ocean shows up in both. We can also see the mountains, which I
would guess to be a snow albedo feedback effect (ever notice how nights get

Despite the winter solstice marking the shortest photoperiod and minimum solar insolation, the ground, oceans, and atmosphere continue to lose more heat via radiative cooling than they gain from gradually increasing sunlight, causing temperatures to keep dropping into January and February. This delayed response is analogous to the way a pot of water continues to cool after being removed from a heat source, as the accumulated energy deficit from previous weeks of low insolation must be offset before warming can begin. The interplay between net radiative flux, latent and sensible heat transfer, and the storage and release of thermal energy in the Earth system underpins this lag, with additional modulation from factors such as snow cover albedo, atmospheric circulation patterns, and regional geography. Consequently, the nadir of average daily temperatures typically occurs several weeks after the solstice, illustrating the complex relationship between astronomical events and terrestrial climate dynamics.","The phenomenon whereby the coldest period of winter in the Northern Hemisphere lags several weeks behind the winter solstice is primarily attributable to the concept of seasonal thermal inertia, governed by the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Despite the winter solstice marking the minimum solar insolation due to the lowest solar elevation angle and shortest photoperiod, terrestrial surfaces—especially those with high specific heat such as oceans, lakes, and even snow-covered ground—retain and gradually release heat accumulated during preceding months, delaying the minimum in surface air temperature. This lag, known as the seasonal temperature lag, results from the imbalance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave terrestrial radiation, with net radiative energy loss persisting until the cumulative energy deficit is reversed by increasing insolation post-solstice. Additionally, atmospheric dynamics such as persistent polar air masses, reduced latent and sensible heat fluxes, and diminished albedo feedback from snow cover further modulate the rate of surface cooling and prolong the period of minimum temperature into January and February. Thus, the coldest days occur after the solstice because the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere continue to lose more energy than they gain until the cumulative effect of increasing solar input overcomes the residual thermal deficit established during the preceding months."

Best of luck!","Martian regolith simulants such as NASA’s JSC Mars-1A and Mojave Mars Simulant (MMS) are engineered to replicate the mineralogy, particle size distribution, and geochemical properties of actual Martian soil, which is primarily composed of basaltic volcanic rock fragments, iron oxides (notably hematite and magnetite, giving Mars its red color), silicates, and perchlorates, with negligible organic content and low nitrogen availability. For a cost-effective terrestrial proxy, a mixture of builders’ sharp sand (for grain size and drainage), horticultural pumice or perlite (to mimic vesicular basaltic fragments), powdered red iron oxide pigment (for ferric content and coloration), and a small amount of garden lime (to adjust pH toward Mars’ mildly alkaline conditions) can approximate the physical and chemical properties, though the absence of perchlorates and trace elements like magnesium sulfate or calcium perchlorate will limit fidelity. The simulant should be nutrient-poor, with minimal organic matter and nitrogen, to reflect Martian regolith’s inhospitable nature for plant growth, and can be further modified by adding Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) and a trace of table salt (sodium chloride) to simulate Martian salt content. The resulting substrate will lack the full suite of trace elements and reactive chemistry (such as perchlorates’ oxidative stress), but will provide a challenging, low-nutrient, mineral-rich medium suitable for experimental plant growth trials and investigation of soil amendment strategies. Key terminology includes regolith, basaltic composition, ferric oxides, perchlorates, nutrient limitation, and simulant fidelity, all of which are central to understanding the constraints and opportunities for astrobiological and agricultural research in Martian analog environments. This approach enables investigation of plant adaptation, microbial inoculation, and soil conditioning in a Mars-analog context using accessible, affordable materials.","Martian regolith, as characterized by in-situ analyses from missions such as Viking, Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, is a basaltic, highly oxidized, anhydrous substrate dominated by silicate minerals (notably plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine), with significant concentrations of iron oxides (imparting the characteristic red hue), sulfates, perchlorates, and trace amounts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium salts, but is notably deficient in organic matter and nitrogenous compounds. To approximate Martian soil using terrestrial materials, one can combine washed builders’ sand (as a silicate matrix), finely crushed basalt or granite gravel (to simulate the mafic mineralogy), horticultural perlite or vermiculite (to mimic regolith porosity and water retention properties), and a small proportion of garden lime (calcium carbonate) to adjust pH, while incorporating iron oxide powder (from pottery suppliers or rust scraped from steel wool) to replicate the ferric oxide content. To simulate the chemical stressors of Martian soil, sodium or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) and potassium chloride (from fertilizer) can be added in low concentrations, and for advanced fidelity, sodium perchlorate (if available and handled with extreme caution due to toxicity) can be introduced to mimic the perchlorate salts detected by Phoenix and Curiosity landers. The resultant simulant will lack the fine-scale particle size distribution, nanophase iron, and atmospheric interactions of true Martian regolith, but will approximate its mineralogical, chemical, and physical constraints for plant growth experiments, especially when kept free of organic amendments and subjected to low-nutrient, low-moisture regimes. For scientific rigor, the simulant’s pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrient profile should be characterized using soil test kits, and the experiment should document plant responses to these stressors, paralleling astrobiological studies on plant viability in extraterrestrial substrates."

There are three main ways to reckon [ seasons
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season) :

  * **Solar.** The 3 months with the greatest insolation are designated summer, so the solstices and equinoxes fall in the middle of the season. In the Celtic calendar, summer started on 1 May; in the traditional Chinese calendar it is [ 5-7 May ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lixia) . The cultural 'Midsummer' and 'Midwinter' festivals reflect this. 
  * **Astronomical.** The solstices and equinoxes are the starts of the seasons, with summer starting on about 21 June ( [ it varies ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) ). Its use dates back at least to the Romans, and it's used in most western cultures today (apparently not in Russia, Australia, or New Zealand). 
  * **Meteorological.** This is what professional meteorologists use (e.g. [ UK Met Office ](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/2014/summer) ), and is based on the prevailing weather on land at mid-latitudes. Seasons are 3 months long and summer starts on 1 June. 

I've tried to illustrate the relationships with insolation and temperature
here:

![Different ways to reckon seasons](https://i.sstatic.net/gWNb5.png)

There are some other ways too:

  * **Ecological.** Scientists who study the behaviour of organisms (hibernation, blooming, etc.) adapt to the local climate, [ sometimes using 6 seasons ](http://seasons2011.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ecological-seasons.html) in temperature zones, or only 2 in polar and tropical ones. 
  * **Agricultural.** This would centre around [ the growing season ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_season) and therefore, in North America and Europe at least, around frost. 
  * **Cultural.** What people think of as 'summer', and what they do outdoors (say), generally seems to line up with local weather patterns. In my own experience, there's no need for these seasons to even be 3 month long; When I lived in Calgary, summer was July and August (hiking), and winter was December to March (skiing). [ Here's another example ](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/yawuru/index.shtml) of a 6-season system, and [ a 3-season system ](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/maung/index.shtml) , from the Aboriginal people of Australia, all based on weather. 

Why do systems with later season starting dates prevail today? Perhaps because
at mid-latitudes, the [ seasonal lag
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag) means that the start of seasonal
weather is weeks later than the start of the 'insolation' period. In a system
with no [ heat capacity ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity) , there
would be no lag. In systems with high heat capacity, like the marine
environment, the lag may be several months (Ibid.). Here's what the lag looks
like in three mid-latitude cities:

![Seasonal lag. Licensed CC-BY-SA by EOEarth](https://i.sstatic.net/jOEgw.png)

The exact same effect happens on a [ diurnal
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation) (daily) basis
too — the warmest part of the day is often not midday (or 1 pm in summer). As
with the seasons, there are lots of other factors too, but the principle is
the same.

These aren't mutually exclusive ways of looking at it — there's clearly lots
of overlap here. Cultural notions of season are surely rooted in astronomy,
weather, and agriculture.","The designation of solstices and equinoxes as the ""first day"" of their respective seasons in the United States is rooted in the astronomical definition of seasons, which aligns seasonal transitions with precise celestial events—namely, the solstices (when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point relative to the celestial equator) and equinoxes (when day and night are approximately equal), rather than with meteorological or phenological markers. This convention contrasts with traditional European and older English nomenclature, where terms like ""Midsummer"" and ""Midwinter"" reflect the solstices' position near the midpoint of the seasonal cycle, a perspective influenced by agricultural calendars and the observable lag in temperature maxima and minima due to thermal inertia, which causes the warmest and coldest periods to occur after the solstices. The shift in American terminology appears to have solidified in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, coinciding with the rise of standardized almanacs, popularization of astronomical definitions in educational materials, and the influence of the U.S. Naval Observatory, though precise documentation of the transition is sparse. Other English-speaking countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, often retain the older system, with meteorological seasons beginning on the first of the month (e.g., June 1 for summer), and many non-English-speaking cultures, such as those in Scandinavia and East Asia, continue to use solstice-based or lunar calendars that place the solstices at the midpoint of the season. The divergence between astronomical and meteorological or cultural definitions of seasons reflects differing priorities—celestial regularity versus climatological experience—and persists as a source of confusion and variation in seasonal nomenclature globally.","The designation of solstices and equinoxes as the ""first day"" of their respective seasons in the United States reflects a modern, astronomical reckoning of the seasons, wherein the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (when the sun crosses the celestial equator) and the summer and winter solstices (when the sun reaches its maximum or minimum declination) serve as precise, observable markers for seasonal transitions, rather than the climatological or phenological midpoints of seasonal change. This convention diverges from traditional European and pre-modern English nomenclature, where terms such as ""Midsummer"" and ""Midwinter"" more accurately correspond to the solstices, aligning with the concept that the solstice represents the temporal midpoint of the season based on solar insolation and daylength, rather than its onset. The rationale for the American system is not rooted in thermal inertia, lag of seasonal temperature maxima and minima, or asymmetrical sunrise and sunset times, but rather in the convenience and universality of astronomical events as fixed calendar markers, despite the fact that climatological seasons—defined by average temperature patterns and thermal lag due to Earth's heat capacity—typically reach their maxima and minima several weeks after the solstices, a phenomenon known as seasonal lag. Historical records indicate that the shift in nomenclature in the United States became standardized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influenced by the adoption of astronomical definitions in almanacs and educational materials, whereas in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries, as well as in many non-English-speaking cultures, the older tradition of associating solstices with the midpoint of the season persists, reflecting a divergence between astronomical and meteorological season definitions. This discrepancy underscores the distinction between astronomical seasons, based on Earth's position relative to the sun, and meteorological seasons, based on climatological averages, with the former providing a globally consistent but physically abstract framework, and the latter offering a more locally relevant, thermally grounded approach to defining seasonal boundaries."

Much of Canada was covered in an extensive ice sheet in the [ last glacial

from about 110 ka until 12 ka. The ice in the Hudson Bay area was among the
last to melt:

![Ice retreat in North America](https://i.sstatic.net/FEFew.png)

A thick ice sheet depresses the crust (the lithosphere), making a small dent
in the uppermost mantle (the [ asthenosphere
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere) ) in the process. Well, not
that small: p 375 in [ Gornitz

Paleoclimatology and Ancient Environments_ ) says it could be 800 m for a 3000
metre-thick ice sheet!

Since the asthenosphere is highly viscous, it takes a long time time for the
depression to 'bounce' back up. This map from Natural Resources Canada shows
the current rate:

This post-glacial rebound outpaces the global mean sea level rise caused by thermal expansion and melting contemporary glaciers, leading to a net local sea level fall despite Hudson Bay's proximity to modern freshwater sources. Additionally, gravitational effects from the loss of the Laurentide Ice Sheet have altered regional ocean mass distribution, further contributing to local sea level anomalies. The hydrological input from nearby glaciers and rivers is insufficient to counteract the dominant isostatic uplift and associated geophysical processes. Consequently, Hudson Bay exemplifies a region where relative sea level trends are governed more by solid Earth dynamics and glacio-isostatic processes than by eustatic sea level changes or proximal freshwater influx.","The pronounced decrease in sea level observed in Hudson Bay is primarily attributable to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), a process wherein the lithosphere and underlying mantle rebound upward following the removal of the immense Pleistocene ice sheets, resulting in significant post-glacial uplift rates that locally outpace global eustatic sea level rise. This vertical land motion, often exceeding 10 mm/year in the Hudson Bay region, causes relative sea level fall as the land surface rises faster than the ocean volume increases from contemporary ice melt and thermal expansion. Despite Hudson Bay’s proximity to modern glacial sources such as the Greenland Ice Sheet, the influx of meltwater is insufficient to counteract the dominant isostatic rebound, and the regional gravitational attraction of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet’s mass loss further redistributes ocean water away from the bay, amplifying local sea level decline. Additionally, the ongoing viscoelastic response of the mantle, coupled with the redistribution of water masses due to gravitational, rotational, and deformational effects (GRD), means that Hudson Bay experiences a unique sea level fingerprint distinct from global mean sea level trends. Consequently, the recession of Hudson Bay’s shoreline is a direct manifestation of complex solid Earth processes and regional hydrodynamics, rather than a simple function of proximity to contemporary glacial meltwater sources."
"Are clouds a solid, liquid, or gas?

I have been looking online and they are often described ambiguously as a ""mass"". For instance, from NASA:

A cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds form when water condenses in the sky. The condensation lets us see the water vapor. There are many different types of clouds. Clouds are an important part of Earth’s weather and climate.

Since they describe it as a vapor, that makes me think it is indeed a gas. But condensation is by definition the change of state from a gas to a liquid. So that makes it sound like it could be a liquid, or contain liquid droplets rather than ""freely moving"" molecules that typically make up a gas.

But at another web site, which doesn't seem all that authoritative, it says that clouds are a solid, liquid, and gas simultaneously!

A cloud is a liquid, a solid, and a gas.

That does seem intriguing. If I remember correctly, liquids are supposed to be incompressible, and clouds are likely compressible.",The post wondered that whether the cloud is gas/liquid/solid.

The cloud that you see is a mixture of solids and liquids. The liquid is water
and the solids are ice, [ cloud condensation nuclei
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei) and ice
condensation nuclei (tiny particulates that water and ice condense on). The
invisible part of clouds that you cannot see is water vapor and dry air. The
majority of the cloud is just plain air in which the invisible water vapor is
mixed with and the very tiny water drops and ice particles are suspended in.

A cloud is a mixture of gas, liquid and solids.","Clouds are composed primarily of tiny liquid water droplets and/or solid ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, with the surrounding air containing water vapor (gaseous H₂O); thus, clouds are not themselves a gas, but rather an aerosol—a colloidal suspension of liquid and/or solid particles within a gas. The visible part of a cloud forms when water vapor in the air undergoes condensation (gas to liquid) or deposition (gas to solid), producing microscopic droplets or crystals that scatter light, making the cloud visible, while the air between these particles remains a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The condensed water droplets in clouds are typically on the order of 10–20 micrometers in diameter, and while individually liquid or solid, their collective behavior as a dispersed phase within a compressible gaseous medium means the cloud as a whole is compressible, unlike bulk liquid water. The phase composition of a cloud can vary with temperature and altitude, with high-altitude clouds (e.g., cirrus) often consisting of ice crystals, while lower clouds (e.g., stratus, cumulus) are predominantly liquid droplets, and mixed-phase clouds containing both are also common. Therefore, clouds are best described as a multiphase system or colloidal suspension, containing solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water, but the visible cloud itself is not a gas; it is the result of condensed water (liquid or solid) dispersed in a gaseous atmosphere.","Clouds are atmospheric phenomena composed primarily of minute liquid water droplets and/or ice crystals suspended within a gaseous matrix of air, resulting from the condensation or deposition of water vapor when air is cooled to its dew point or when it becomes supersaturated. The visible portion of a cloud is not water vapor (which is an invisible gas), but rather a colloidal dispersion of condensed phase water—either as liquid microdroplets (typically 10–20 micrometers in diameter) or solid ice crystals—distributed throughout the troposphere or, in some cases, higher atmospheric layers. While the bulk medium in which clouds exist is air (a mixture of gases), the defining feature of a cloud is the presence of these condensed water particles, which scatter sunlight and render the cloud visible; thus, clouds are not themselves a gas, but rather a suspension of liquid and/or solid water in a gaseous environment. The compressibility of clouds arises from the properties of the surrounding air, not from the water droplets or ice crystals themselves, as liquids and solids are largely incompressible at atmospheric pressures, but the overall cloud volume can change with air pressure and temperature. In summary, clouds are best characterized as heterogeneous mixtures or colloidal suspensions, consisting of liquid and/or solid water particles dispersed within a continuous gaseous phase, and their physical state is defined by the phase of the suspended water (liquid or solid), not by the surrounding air, making them neither purely solid, liquid, nor gas, but rather a multiphase system integral to atmospheric processes and the hydrological cycle."

Yes, there are lots of other factors.

Factors affecting sea levels are no different from other natural processes:
there is a large number of coupled, non-linear effects, operating on every
time scale, and at every length scale, and across many orders of magnitude.

The Wikipedia page [ Current sea level rise
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise) lists many of the known
processes. And I wrote a blog post, [ Scales of sea-level change
](http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2011/4/11/scales-of-sea-level-

& Aubrey (1991). Here's the table from it:

![Factors affecting global sea levels](https://i.sstatic.net/hqb0B.png)

**Reference** Emery, K & D Aubrey (1991). _Sea-Levels, Land Levels and Tide
Gauges._ Springer-Verlag, New York, 237p.","Sea level is influenced by numerous factors beyond terrestrial ice storage and ocean temperature, including the addition of sediment and dissolved solids from rivers, which increases ocean mass but at a geologically slow rate, contributing less than 0.02 mm/year to global mean sea level rise, a negligible fraction compared to thermal expansion and ice melt. Tectonic processes such as seafloor spreading, subduction, and orogenesis alter ocean basin volume and continental elevations, causing regional and global sea level changes on timescales of millions of years, with events like mid-ocean ridge volume fluctuations potentially shifting sea level by tens to hundreds of meters over geologic epochs. Volcanic activity, particularly large igneous province emplacement or submarine volcanism, can displace ocean water and modify basin geometry, but the net effect on global sea level is typically minor compared to other drivers, except during rare, massive events. Isostatic adjustments, including glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and sediment loading, cause vertical land motion that affects relative sea level locally, while hydro-isostatic equilibrium is never fully achieved due to ongoing tectonic, erosional, and sedimentary processes, precluding a uniform ocean depth or global hydrostatic equilibrium. The interplay of eustatic (global), isostatic (vertical land movement), and steric (density-driven) sea level components, along with water mass exchange among reservoirs, governs both short-term and long-term sea level variability, with anthropogenic climate change currently dominating observed trends.","Beyond the dominant influences of terrestrial ice storage and ocean temperature (thermal expansion), global mean sea level is modulated by a suite of geophysical and geochemical processes, including the addition of terrigenous sediment and dissolved solutes, tectonic deformation, mantle dynamic topography, glacio-isostatic adjustment, and anthropogenic groundwater extraction. The influx of sediment and dissolved material from continental erosion and riverine input increases ocean mass, but the cumulative effect is minuscule, with estimates suggesting a global sea level rise of approximately 0.02 mm per year, orders of magnitude smaller than contributions from thermal expansion or ice melt. Volcanic and tectonic processes, such as seafloor spreading, subduction, and large igneous province emplacement, alter ocean basin volume and bathymetry, with events like the emplacement of oceanic plateaus or mid-ocean ridge volume changes potentially shifting global sea level by tens of meters over millions of years, though the annualized effect is negligible on human timescales. Hydro-isostatic and glacio-isostatic adjustments, resulting from the redistribution of mass following deglaciation or sediment loading, induce regional and global sea level changes by modifying the geoid and crustal elevation, while groundwater depletion and reservoir impoundment redistribute water between land and ocean, contributing up to ~0.3 mm/yr to contemporary sea level rise. The tendency toward hydrostatic equilibrium is constrained by the heterogeneous distribution of continental and oceanic lithosphere, isostatic compensation, and dynamic topography, precluding a scenario where Earth is entirely covered by a uniform ocean, as the interplay of tectonics, mantle convection, and crustal buoyancy maintains persistent bathymetric and topographic relief."

The physical process you describe is known as [ wave shoaling
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_shoaling) .

At the basic level, waves propagating into shallow water become shorter and
higher, and consequently, steeper. In shallow water, the water particles near
the crest move **forward** faster than those below them. Similarly, the
particles near the trough move **backward** faster than those above them. This
causes strong shearing of the near-surface body of water, eventually forming a
plunging breaker, or a surf wave. For small-slope (linear) and inviscid (no
friction) waves, the above is a consequence of the bottom boundary condition
for the water velocity to be zero at the sea floor.

There are two fundamental and related properties of water waves that
contribute to shoaling. One is the wave frequency $\omega$ remaining constant
as the depth $d$ decreases. Think of this as the conservation of wave crests
at any fixed point. However, the wavenumber $k$ (wavelength $\lambda$) must
increase (decrease) with decreasing depth, as per the [ dispersion
relationship ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_%28water_waves%29) of
water waves (neglecting the effects of viscosity):

$$\omega^{2} = gk\tanh{(kd)}$$

where $g$ is gravitational acceleration. In shallow water, the dispersion
relationship reduces to:

$$\omega = \sqrt{gd}k $$

and phase speed $C_p$ and group velocity $C_g$ are both proportional to the
square root of the water depth:

$$ C_p = \dfrac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{gd} $$

$$ C_g = \dfrac{\partial\omega}{\partial k} = \sqrt{gd} $$

Individual wave crests propagate with phase speed $C_p$. Wave groups and wave
energy propagate with group velocity $C_g$. Thus, waves entering shallow water
become **shorter** and **slower** . The second important property leading to
shoaling is the conservation of wave energy flux, which is proportional to the
group velocity and wave energy:

$$\dfrac{\partial(C_{g}E)}{\partial x}=0$$

Because the group velocity decreases, the wave energy (read: height) must
increase (locally). This causes the waves to grow in height as they enter
shallow water. As pointed out by @IsopycnalOscillation in a comment above, the
separation of water particles from the wave crests happen because the
individual orbital velocities at the top of the crest exceed by far the phase
speed of the wave.

Although bottom friction is significant and non-negligible in shallow water,
it does not cause shoaling. Mathematically, wave shoaling can occur for
completely inviscid and small-slope (linear) waves that propagate into water
of decreasing depth.","As ocean waves approach shallow coastal regions, their interaction with the seafloor initiates a process known as wave shoaling, wherein the wave base begins to drag against the bottom, causing a reduction in wave speed due to friction and a corresponding decrease in wavelength while wave height increases due to energy conservation. This differential in velocity between the crest (which continues moving at a higher speed) and the trough (which is slowed by bottom friction) induces a steepening of the wave face, resulting in the upper portion of the wave advancing ahead of the lower portion. When the wave steepness exceeds a critical threshold—typically when the wave height to wavelength ratio surpasses 1:7—the crest becomes unstable and curls forward, forming the characteristic plunging or spilling breaker shape, depending on the slope of the seabed and wave energy. The forward-curling motion is further accentuated by the orbital motion of water particles within the wave, which transitions from nearly circular in deep water to increasingly elliptical as depth decreases, amplifying the forward momentum of the crest relative to the base. This dynamic culminates in the wave breaking, dissipating energy as turbulence and foam, commonly referred to as ""white wash,"" and is governed by principles of fluid dynamics, conservation of energy, and the interplay between gravitational and frictional forces in the nearshore environment.","As ocean surface gravity waves propagate from deep to shallow water, their interaction with the decreasing water depth causes a reduction in wave celerity due to frictional drag with the seabed, resulting in wavelength shortening and wave height amplification through the process of wave shoaling. The orbital motion of water particles, initially circular in deep water, becomes increasingly elliptical and compressed vertically as the wave base interacts with the seafloor, causing the wave crest to steepen relative to the trough. When the wave steepness (ratio of wave height to wavelength) exceeds a critical threshold, typically around 1:7, the crest advances faster than the trough due to differential velocities, leading to the characteristic forward and downward curling of the upper portion of the wave. This instability culminates in wave breaking, where the crest collapses under gravity, entraining air and generating turbulent, aerated ""white water"" or surf, a process governed by the interplay of hydrodynamic instability, energy dissipation, and momentum transfer. The specific morphology of the breaking wave—spilling, plunging, surging, or collapsing—is further modulated by local bathymetry, wave energy, and sediment characteristics, all of which are critical in coastal geomorphology and sediment transport dynamics."

These features often originate at transform faults and spreading centers, where lithospheric plates diverge and create new oceanic crust, and the observed regular spacing—approximately every 8 degrees of longitude—corresponds to the segmentation of the mid-ocean ridge system and the periodicity of transform faults and fracture zones. The alignment of these striations from the continental margins of North and South America toward the central Pacific, converging near Tahiti, reflects the geometry of Pacific Plate motion and the orientation of ancient spreading centers, as well as the influence of the Pacific-Antarctic and Pacific-Nazca plate boundaries. The apparent convergence and angular offset between northern and southern sets of striations are due to the differing orientations of spreading segments and the complex tectonic history involving changes in plate motion vectors and ridge jumps over millions of years. These bathymetric lineaments are further accentuated by sediment cover variations and differential subsidence, and their visibility on satellite altimetry-derived gravity maps and bathymetric data is a testament to the interplay between tectonic, volcanic, and sedimentary processes shaping the ocean floor.","The observed east-west striations across the Eastern Pacific, visible on Google Earth and extending from continental shelves toward Hawaii and converging near Tahiti, are prominent examples of marine magnetic anomalies, specifically oceanic fracture zones and abyssal hills, which are linear geomorphic and geophysical features formed by seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges and subsequent plate tectonic motion. These features manifest as alternating bands of differing magnetic polarity, created by episodic geomagnetic reversals recorded in the basaltic oceanic crust as it cools and solidifies at spreading centers such as the East Pacific Rise, and are further accentuated by transform faults and fracture zones that offset the mid-ocean ridge segments in an en echelon pattern. The regular spacing, such as the approximately 8-degree intervals, reflects the periodicity of geomagnetic reversals and the rate of seafloor spreading, with the east-west orientation paralleling the direction of plate divergence and the transform fault system, while the apparent convergence of striations near Tahiti is a cartographic artifact resulting from the spherical geometry of the Earth and the projection used in mapping. The alignment of these features from continental margins to the central Pacific provides a record of plate kinematics, paleomagnetic history, and the dynamic processes governing lithospheric accretion and deformation, with the fracture zones serving as markers of past ridge axis positions and the boundaries between lithospheric plates of differing ages and thermal structures. These striations are not the result of erosional or depositional processes but are instead tectonic in origin, representing the interplay between magmatic accretion at mid-ocean ridges, transform faulting, and the global geomagnetic reversal chronology, and their study is fundamental to the reconstruction of plate motions and the understanding of ocean basin evolution."

The content below is based on expressions found in [ Wind gradient
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gradient) from Wikipedia. See that link
for more background information.

Wind speed as a function of height can be modeled with the following
expression:

$$v_2 = v_1 \left(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\right)^a$$

Where  $v_1$  and  $v_2$  are the wind speeds are heights  $h_1$  and  $h_2$
,  $a$  is a parameter related to the atmospheric stability.

Given your two values for wind speed at different height we want to solve for
$a$  :

$$a = \frac{\ln(v_2/v_1)}{\ln(h_2/h_1)}$$

You can now use this value, along with the original height / wind speed pairs
to evaluate the wind speed at a different height.

The model will likely be best when the evaluated hight is between the points
used to compute  $a$  , basically interpolation will be better than
extrapolation.","Wind speed variation with height above ground is typically nonlinear due to the influence of surface roughness, atmospheric stability, and boundary layer processes, and is often modeled using the logarithmic wind profile or the power law, both of which account for the decrease in frictional effects with height. Simply averaging wind speeds at 80m and 120m to estimate the speed at 100m assumes a linear relationship, which neglects the established nonlinear vertical wind shear and may introduce significant error, especially in the lower atmospheric boundary layer where wind speed increases rapidly with height. The logarithmic wind profile, expressed as \( u(z) = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \ln\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right) \), where \( u(z) \) is wind speed at height \( z \), \( u_* \) is friction velocity, \( \kappa \) is the von Kármán constant, and \( z_0 \) is surface roughness length, is widely used for neutral atmospheric conditions, while the power law \( u(z) = u_{ref} \left(\frac{z}{z_{ref}}\right)^\alpha \) is a common empirical alternative, with \( \alpha \) typically ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 depending on terrain and stability. To interpolate wind speed at 100m, it is more accurate to fit the logarithmic or power law profile to the known values at 80m and 120m, then solve for the speed at 100m, rather than using a simple arithmetic mean. In summary, wind speed as a function of height is best represented by nonlinear profiles, and using such models is essential for accurate vertical interpolation, particularly for applications in wind energy, meteorology, and atmospheric science.","Wind speed variation with height above the surface is governed by the vertical wind profile, which is typically nonlinear due to the influence of surface roughness, atmospheric stability, and turbulence, and is most accurately described by the logarithmic wind profile or, under certain conditions, the power law profile. The logarithmic wind law, derived from boundary layer theory, expresses wind speed as a logarithmic function of height above ground, incorporating parameters such as surface roughness length and friction velocity, while the empirical power law relates wind speed to height using an exponent (the wind shear exponent, α) that encapsulates surface and atmospheric conditions. Averaging wind speeds at 80 m and 120 m to estimate the speed at 100 m assumes linearity, which neglects the nonlinear acceleration of wind with height due to decreasing frictional drag and changing turbulent mixing, especially within the surface layer. For precise interpolation, one should fit the observed wind speeds to either the logarithmic or power law profile and solve for the wind speed at the desired height, thereby accounting for the actual vertical structure of the wind field. Therefore, a nonlinear function—specifically, the logarithmic or power law profile—is more appropriate for interpolating wind speed between two heights within the atmospheric boundary layer, and simple linear averaging is not physically justified except over very small height intervals or in rare cases of near-neutral stratification and homogeneous terrain."

To address the inherent infertility and poor water retention of desert sands, the project will likely employ soil conditioning techniques such as the addition of clay, compost, gypsum, or biochar, as well as the introduction of salt-tolerant pioneer crops and afforestation to stabilize the substrate and initiate pedogenesis. Over time, repeated irrigation and organic input can facilitate the development of a viable soil profile, improve cation exchange capacity, and foster the establishment of a rhizosphere conducive to sustained agriculture.

According to **Newton's Law of Gravity** based on attractive force
(gravitational force) that two masses exert on each other:

$$F=\frac{GmM}{r^2}$$

Where:

  * $F$  is the gravitational force 
  * $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\ \mathrm{m}^3\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}\ \mathrm{s}^{-2}$  is a constant of proportionality 
  * $M$  and  $m$  are the two masses exerting the forces 
  * $r$  is the distance between the two centers of mass. 

From **Newton's second law of motion** :

$$F=ma$$

Where:

  * $F$  is the force applied to an object 
  * $m$  is the mass of the object 
  * $a$  is its acceleration due to the force. 

**Equating both the equations** :

$$F = \frac{GmM}{r^2} = ma$$

$$\frac{GM}{r^2}= a$$  (The  $m$  's canceled out.)

Now solve for  $M$  , the mass of the Earth.

$$M = \frac{ar^2}{G}$$

Where  $a = 9.8\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{s}^{-2}$  ,  $r = 6.4 \times 10^6\

$$M = 9.8 \times (6.4 \times 10^6)^2/(6.67 \times 10^{-11})\ \mathrm{kg}$$

The value of G was first measured accurately by Henry Cavendish in 1798 using a torsion balance, allowing for the calculation of the Earth’s mass from terrestrial gravitational measurements. Additional confirmation comes from analyzing the orbits of satellites and the Moon, applying Kepler’s third law and Newtonian mechanics to relate orbital parameters to the Earth’s mass.

"My question refers to the current process of climate change. CO2 is rising, which leads to the greenhouse effect, which raises temperatures. This leads to more wildfires, which reduces number of trees, increasing CO2 and reducing CO2 capacity absorption. Ice caps start to melt, which reduces sunlight reflection (less snow), trapping more heat on atmosphere. Water rises, taking over land and trees, further enhancing the CO2 absorption capacity. Oceans acidify, lowering their CO2 absorption capacity too. Etc etc.

There are indeed a lot of positive feedback mechanisms, i.e. a warm climate
leads to a warmer climate. From [ this Wikipedia article
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback) , they are:

  * Carbon cycle feedbacks 
  * Cloud feedback 
  * Gas release 
  * Ice-albedo feedback 
  * Water vapor feedback 

However, there are also a few negative feedbacks (same source):

  * Blackbody radiation 
  * Carbon cycle 
  * Lapse rate 
  * Impacts on humans 

Now the question is: what is the net budget between positive and negative
feedbacks? To assess this, climatologists use some metrics, the main ones
being ""transient climate response"" (TCR) and ""equilibrium climate sensitivity""
(ECS). From [ Knutti et al. (2017) ](https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo3017) :

Which basically means that the climate will get warmer in the future, until it
will eventually reach some kind of equilibrium.","The current process of climate change is characterized by multiple positive feedback loops, such as the greenhouse effect intensifying with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which increases global mean temperatures, exacerbates wildfires, reduces terrestrial carbon sinks, and accelerates cryosphere melt, thereby decreasing albedo and amplifying radiative forcing. These feedback mechanisms, including permafrost thaw releasing methane and ocean stratification reducing carbon sequestration, collectively reinforce the warming trend and contribute to Earth system tipping points. However, negative feedbacks also exist, such as increased plant growth in some regions due to CO2 fertilization, enhanced weathering of silicate rocks that draw down CO2, and certain cloud feedbacks that may increase planetary albedo, though their magnitude and persistence are uncertain and often insufficient to counteract dominant positive feedbacks. Anthropogenic interventions, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, afforestation, and emissions mitigation, represent potential counteracting forces, but their large-scale deployment and efficacy remain limited compared to the accelerating pace of climate-driven feedbacks. Overall, the climate system exhibits a complex interplay of reinforcing and dampening processes, but current scientific consensus indicates that positive feedbacks are presently outpacing negative ones, necessitating urgent mitigation and adaptation strategies to avoid irreversible climate impacts.","The current trajectory of anthropogenic climate change is characterized by a complex interplay of positive feedback mechanisms, such as the greenhouse effect amplification via rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which intensifies radiative forcing and global mean surface temperature, subsequently exacerbating wildfire frequency and severity, leading to deforestation and diminished terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity. The cryospheric response, notably the accelerated melting of polar ice caps and snow cover, reduces planetary albedo, thereby increasing net solar energy absorption and further amplifying atmospheric and oceanic warming, while sea level rise inundates coastal vegetative carbon sinks, further diminishing biospheric CO2 uptake. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO2 dissolution forming carbonic acid, disrupts marine carbonate chemistry, impairs calcifying organisms, and reduces the ocean’s long-term carbon buffering and sequestration efficacy, compounding the atmospheric CO2 burden. Despite these reinforcing (positive) feedbacks, the Earth system also exhibits negative feedbacks, such as enhanced silicate weathering rates under warmer, wetter conditions, which draw down atmospheric CO2 over geological timescales, and potential increases in net primary productivity in certain regions due to CO2 fertilization, although these are often insufficient to offset rapid anthropogenic emissions. The net effect is a dynamic disequilibrium where positive feedbacks currently dominate, accelerating climate change, while negative feedbacks operate on longer timescales or with limited magnitude, thus failing to fully counteract the ongoing perturbation of the global carbon cycle and Earth’s energy balance."

> Is there geological (or other physical) evidence here on Earth that confirms

No, there isn't. This is, however, plenty of evidence that the moon formed due
to a collision of a third body (sometimes referred to as Theia) with the
Earth, and the moon formed from the ring of debris that resulted from the
collision.

This theory is often known as the _[ Giant Impact Hypothesis
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis) _ and searching for
this term may help you find other links and references elsewhere.

> If so what is that evidence?

To summarise the geological evidence, much of it is **indirect** evidence, in
that it compares geology on the Moon with similar geology or features on the
Earth, and draws conclusions to explain the similarities (or discrepancies).

Because of the sheer size of the proposed impact, it would have likely
reconfigured the surfaces of both bodies entirely, and so finding direct
physical evidence on the Earth would be extremely unlikely. (e.g. a massive
hidden crater would simply no longer exist)

##  Geological Evidence

  * Moon rocks collected from the Apollo missions that have almost identical oxygen isotope ratios to similar rocks found on Earth of the same age. 
  * A large portion of the Lunar crust is made up of Anorthosite, which is indicative of a large melting event. (with the energy for this supplied from the impact) 
  * Zinc. Lunar rocks contain less zinc, but with heavier _isotopes_ of Zn than those found on Earth, which by contrast has lighter isotopes in greater abundance. This is consistent with zinc being depleted from the moon by evaporation, such as during a massive impact event. 

  * Density and volatiles. The Moon is 25% less dense than the uncompressed density of Earth. It is severely depleted in volatiles, with practically no water and less than half the potassium abundance that Earth has. The combination of low density and lack of volatiles implies that the Moon was not a simple accretion of early solar system material, but resembles the Earth's mantle in bulk composition. Volatile material would have been vapourised by the impact. 

  * The bulk composition of the Moon's crust. (This one does not actually involve the Earth, but I feel it is still important to mention.) The Moon's mantle and crust chemical composition _could_ be explained if the Moon had a large iron core, but its core is actually quite small. 

##  Other Physical Evidence

  * The ratio of the Earth and Moon's mass far exceeds any other planet in the solar system, and this begs the question of how did so much material become in orbit of the Earth. (Not evidence as such, but raises the question in the first place) 

  * Getting more indirect...there are bands of warm silica-rich dust orbiting nearby stars which is interpreted as planet-sized bodies having collided with each other, so there is precedent for similar events happening elsewhere in the galaxy. (Again, I realise this is one is not strictly answering the question, but Earth Scientists often have to look well outside the Earth to answer their questions!) 

Hope this gets you started!

Geochemical analyses reveal that both Earth and Moon have nearly identical ratios of stable isotopes such as titanium, silicon, and tungsten, which is unexpected if the Moon had formed elsewhere or been captured, thus supporting a shared history through a massive collision. The depletion of volatile elements and siderophile (iron-loving) elements in lunar samples, as compared to Earth, aligns with high-temperature processes expected from a giant impact event, indicating that the Moon formed from material that was partially vaporized and differentiated. The angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, as well as the Moon's relatively small iron core compared to Earth, are consistent with simulations of a glancing impact that stripped away much of the proto-Earth's mantle and left the Moon with a composition similar to Earth's silicate-rich outer layers. While direct geological evidence of the impact on Earth has been erased by billions of years of tectonic activity and resurfacing, the converging lines of isotopic, geochemical, and dynamical evidence from both Earth and lunar samples constitute robust physical evidence supporting the Moon's origin via a giant impact with the early Earth.","The prevailing Giant Impact Hypothesis posits that the Moon formed from debris ejected after a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized body (Theia) during the Hadean Eon, and multiple lines of geochemical and isotopic evidence on Earth and in lunar samples support this scenario. Terrestrial and lunar rocks exhibit nearly identical oxygen isotope ratios (Δ17O), indicating a common origin or extensive post-impact mixing, while the depletion of volatile elements and siderophile (iron-loving) elements in lunar material relative to Earth’s mantle suggests high-temperature processing consistent with a massive impact event. The anomalously high angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, the Moon’s small iron core relative to its size, and the Earth’s relatively rapid rotation rate are dynamical features best explained by a giant impact, as alternative models (such as co-accretion or capture) fail to reproduce these characteristics. Geochronological constraints from ancient zircons and isotopic systems (e.g., Hf-W, Sm-Nd) indicate a major differentiation event on Earth around 4.5 billion years ago, temporally coincident with the hypothesized impact, while the absence of primordial crust older than ~4.0 Ga on Earth is consistent with wholesale crustal reprocessing by such a cataclysmic event. Although direct physical remnants of the impactor or impact structure are absent due to subsequent planetary resurfacing and tectonic recycling, the convergence of isotopic, geochemical, and dynamical evidence constitutes robust indirect geological support for the Moon’s origin via a giant impact on the early Earth."

The oceanic plates are themselves formed from the [ divergent boundary

The absence of well-documented land-ocean divergent boundaries on Earth arises because divergent boundaries typically initiate either within continental lithosphere (producing rift valleys that may eventually evolve into new ocean basins) or between oceanic plates (resulting in mid-ocean ridges), but not at the interface of continental and oceanic lithosphere, where transform or convergent boundaries are more prevalent. The transition from continental rifting to oceanic spreading is a geologically complex process, involving the progressive thinning and eventual rupture of continental crust, followed by the emplacement of new oceanic crust, but this transitional phase is not classified as a stable, long-lived land-ocean divergent boundary. In plate tectonic theory, the boundary between continental and oceanic lithosphere is typically a passive margin, not an active plate boundary, and thus does not exhibit the characteristic features of divergence such as volcanism and rift valleys at the interface. Therefore, for procedural planet generation aiming for geological realism, it is accurate to restrict divergent boundaries to land-land (continental rift zones) and ocean-ocean (mid-ocean ridges) settings, with land-ocean interfaces more appropriately modeled as passive margins or, less commonly, transform or convergent boundaries.","Divergent plate boundaries, defined as tectonic margins where lithospheric plates move apart due to extensional forces, predominantly manifest as mid-ocean ridges (ocean-ocean divergence) or continental rift zones (land-land divergence), with the classic examples being the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East African Rift, respectively. The absence of land-ocean divergent boundaries on Earth arises from the fundamental mechanics of plate tectonics: divergent boundaries initiate either within continental crust, forming continental rifts that may eventually evolve into new ocean basins, or within oceanic crust, generating new oceanic lithosphere through seafloor spreading. At the interface of continental and oceanic lithosphere, the dominant tectonic regime is typically a passive margin, characterized by tectonic quiescence and sediment accumulation, rather than active divergence, as the transition from continental to oceanic crust is a product of prior rifting and subsequent seafloor spreading rather than ongoing plate separation. The geodynamic processes at divergent boundaries involve upwelling of asthenospheric mantle, decompression melting, and the creation of new lithosphere, with the nature of the boundary—continental or oceanic—determined by the composition and thickness of the overlying crust and the thermal regime. For procedural planet generation aiming for geologic plausibility, it is accurate to restrict divergent boundaries to land-land (continental rift) and ocean-ocean (mid-ocean ridge) settings, as land-ocean divergent boundaries lack real-world analogs due to the inherent tectonic evolution of passive margins and the absence of active plate separation at such interfaces."

Yes, if one takes the common meaning of the term [ ""eye of the storm""
](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Eye) to be the area of relatively low wind
speed near the center of the vortex, most tornadoes can be said to have eyes.
Cyclostrophic balance describes a steady-state, inviscid flow with neglected
Coriolis force:

$$ \dfrac{v^2}{r} = -\dfrac{1}{\rho}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial n} $$

where centripetal force balances radial pressure gradient. Here, $v$ is
tangential wind speed, $r$ distance from vortex center, $\rho$ is air density,
$p$ is atmospheric pressure and $n$ is the radial direction pointing inward.
From here, tangential wind speed is simply:

$$ v = \sqrt{-\dfrac{r}{\rho}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial n}} $$

suggesting that $v\to0$ when $r\to0$. While the flow in tornadoes is highly
non-stationary and subject to friction, this idealized model shows why there
must exist an ""eye"" inside a vortex or an area of closed circulation. This
""eye"" may or may not be easily recognized by a hypothetical human observer
inside a tornado.","Tornadoes, unlike hurricanes, do not possess a true ""eye"" in the meteorological sense; while hurricanes have a well-defined, calm, and low-pressure eye at their center due to their large, organized, and sustained cyclonic structure, tornadoes are much smaller, more chaotic, and transient vortices, typically lacking a persistent, calm central region. Eyewitness accounts, such as Will Keller's 1928 report and similar anecdotal observations, describe temporary clearings or calm regions within intense tornadoes, sometimes called a ""central cavity"" or ""vortex breakdown,"" but these are rare, short-lived phenomena resulting from complex internal vortex dynamics, such as multiple-vortex structures, suction vortices, or transient downdrafts, rather than a stable eye. Scientific documentation, including Doppler radar observations, photogrammetry, and in situ probes, has occasionally captured transient low-pressure cores or visual ""clear slots"" within violent tornadoes, but these features are not analogous to the hurricane eye and are not consistently present or structurally similar across tornadoes. The popular depiction of tornadoes having a hurricane-like eye, as seen in films like Into the Storm (2014), is largely a dramatization and not supported by the majority of peer-reviewed meteorological literature or official documentation from agencies such as the National Weather Service or the Storm Prediction Center. In summary, while rare transient central clearings may occur in some violent tornadoes due to internal vortex dynamics, the concept of a persistent, hurricane-like eye in tornadoes is not scientifically recognized and is best regarded as a myth or misinterpretation of complex tornado structure.","The concept of a tornado possessing an ""eye"" analogous to the well-defined, calm, and structurally persistent eye of a mature tropical cyclone is not supported by contemporary meteorological research or official documentation; tornadoes, even in the most intense (EF4–EF5) cases, are characterized by a violently rotating column of air with a central low-pressure core, but lack the organized, subsiding, and clear-air eye structure observed in hurricanes. Eyewitness accounts such as Will Keller’s 1928 report and cinematic depictions like Into the Storm (2014) often describe transient, visually clear central regions within large tornadoes, which are more accurately attributed to temporary reductions in debris density, rapid condensation fluctuations, or the presence of a multiple-vortex structure, rather than a true dynamically stable eye. Doppler radar observations and photogrammetric analyses have documented central voids or ""clear slots"" in some large wedge tornadoes, but these features are ephemeral, highly turbulent, and lack the subsidence and stratiform cloud-free characteristics of a hurricane eye. The intense updrafts, extreme pressure gradients, and chaotic internal flow within tornadoes preclude the formation of a stable, calm eye, as the vortex core is dominated by strong upward motion, debris, and condensation, with any apparent central clearing being a visual artifact rather than a dynamically distinct region. Thus, while anecdotal and visual reports of ""eyes"" in tornadoes persist in popular culture and historical accounts, the prevailing scientific consensus, grounded in radar, in situ, and theoretical studies, is that tornadoes do not possess true eyes in the meteorological sense, and such descriptions are best understood as misinterpretations of transient internal features or observational artifacts."
"I have heard from many people that sinks do not empty in a particular pattern depending on what hemisphere you are in, but I have also heard from people who adamant that a sink of water would empty clockwise in one hemisphere and anti-clockwise in another.

You can use the [ Foucault pendulum
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum) to determine the hemisphere:
Its plane of movement rotates:

  * anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere; 
  * clockwise in the northern hemisphere. 

The rotation of the plane can be explained by the Coriolis force.","The belief that water drains in opposite directions in sinks or toilets depending on the hemisphere is a widespread misconception rooted in the Coriolis effect, which describes the apparent deflection of moving objects due to Earth's rotation and is significant in large-scale phenomena such as atmospheric circulation and ocean currents, but negligible in small-scale systems like household sinks, where initial water motion, basin geometry, and residual currents overwhelmingly determine the direction of rotation. The Coriolis force, mathematically expressed as F = 2m(v × Ω), where v is velocity and Ω is the angular velocity of Earth's rotation, is only appreciable over large distances and timescales, making it undetectable in typical domestic draining scenarios. To empirically observe the Coriolis effect in water, highly controlled laboratory experiments with large, symmetrical tanks, minimal initial motion, and long settling times are required, as famously demonstrated by Ascher Shapiro at MIT, but such conditions are impractical for casual or field experiments. No simple, everyday experiment utilizing the Coriolis effect exists that can reliably determine one's hemisphere, as local influences vastly overshadow the minuscule hemispheric bias in small-scale water drainage. Determining hemisphere location is more accurately achieved through astronomical observations, such as the apparent motion of the sun or stars, rather than relying on the misapplied Coriolis effect in sinks or toilets.","The widespread belief that sinks or bathtubs drain in a direction determined by hemisphere, specifically clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, is a misapplication of the Coriolis effect, which is a consequence of Earth's rotation influencing large-scale geophysical flows such as atmospheric circulation and oceanic currents, but is negligible at the scale of household plumbing due to the overwhelming dominance of initial water motion, basin geometry, and local turbulence. The Coriolis force, mathematically expressed as 2mΩv sin(φ) where Ω is Earth's angular velocity, v is the velocity of the moving object, φ is latitude, and m is mass, becomes significant only over large spatial and temporal scales, such as in cyclonic systems where it imparts the characteristic counterclockwise rotation to low-pressure systems in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, a phenomenon known as cyclonic vorticity. Attempts to demonstrate hemispheric location using small-scale draining experiments are confounded by the minuscule magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration relative to other forces, rendering such demonstrations unreliable without extreme experimental control, such as using a perfectly symmetrical basin, quiescent water, and allowing several hours for the water to settle, as shown in controlled laboratory settings but not in typical domestic environments. To empirically determine hemisphere using the Coriolis effect, one must observe large-scale geophysical phenomena such as the rotation of tropical cyclones, the deflection of trade winds, or the orientation of oceanic gyres, all of which manifest the Coriolis-induced hemispheric asymmetry, rather than relying on small-scale hydrodynamic experiments. Therefore, while the Coriolis effect is a fundamental principle in Earth system science, its practical demonstration for hemispheric determination requires observation of planetary-scale fluid dynamics rather than household-scale water drainage, and no simple, reliable sink-based experiment exists for this purpose outside of rigorously controlled scientific conditions."

According to wikipedia, there are around 5.5 million tonnes of [ uranium in

that are commercially viable at current prices, and perhaps 35 million tonnes
that are potentially viable if prices increase.

Also according to wikipedia, [ the Earth's crust

contains an estimated 10^14 tonnes (100 trillion tonnes), while the oceans may
contain 10^10 tonnes (10 billion tonnes). This presumably includes the ore
figures stated above.

The previous link states that ""The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40

estimate is given for quantities. Allègre, Lewin and Dupré (1988) state that
""The concentration of U in the primordial mantle (bulk Earth) has been

Uranium is classified as a lithophile element, preferentially partitioning into silicate phases during planetary differentiation, which results in its relative enrichment in the crust compared to the mantle and core, although geochemical models suggest that significant quantities may also reside in the mantle and possibly the core, where radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium isotopes contributes to Earth's internal heat budget and geodynamo processes. Economically viable uranium deposits, such as those exploited for nuclear fuel, typically exhibit concentrations orders of magnitude higher than average crustal abundance, often exceeding 0.1% (1,000 ppm) in ore bodies like those found in unconformity-related, sandstone-hosted, and vein-type deposits, with extraction feasibility governed by factors including ore grade, deposit size, mineralogy, and technological advancements in mining and processing. Uranium's geochemical behavior is influenced by its oxidation states (U⁴⁺ and U⁶⁺), solubility, and mobility in hydrothermal and surface environments, which control its redistribution and concentration into minable deposits. While the core is hypothesized to contain some uranium, direct evidence is lacking due to inaccessibility, and the vast majority of uranium resources available for human use are restricted to the crust, with current resource estimates and extraction technologies determining the long-term sustainability of uranium supply for energy generation and other applications.","Estimates of uranium abundance in Earth's continental crust converge around an average concentration of approximately 2.7 parts per million (ppm) by weight, with total uranium mass in the crust calculated at roughly 2.8 × 10¹⁷ kilograms, predominantly occurring as uraninite (UO₂) and disseminated within granitic, sedimentary, and phosphate rock matrices. Uranium's geochemical behavior classifies it as a lithophile element, favoring concentration in the crust over the mantle or core due to its incompatibility during partial melting and its affinity for silicate phases, although trace quantities are hypothesized to exist in the core, potentially contributing to radiogenic heat production alongside isotopes such as potassium-40 and thorium-232. The economic viability of uranium extraction is governed by ore grade, with most currently exploited deposits exhibiting concentrations from 0.1% to over 20% U₃O₈, though the vast majority of crustal uranium is dispersed at sub-economic grades, necessitating advances in extraction technology or shifts in market dynamics to render lower-grade resources exploitable. Uranium's crustal distribution is heterogeneous, with elevated concentrations associated with specific geological settings such as unconformity-related deposits, sandstone-hosted deposits, and volcanic tuffs, reflecting the influence of hydrothermal processes, redox gradients, and sedimentary basin evolution on uranium mobility and accumulation. While the core's uranium content remains speculative and inaccessible for resource purposes, the crustal uranium endowment represents the principal reservoir for anthropogenic utilization, underpinning both nuclear fuel cycles and geochronological applications through isotopic systems such as uranium-lead dating."

For the ozone layer to dissolve, it would need something to bind to. [
Chloroflurocarbons ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon) are one
very notable thing that it can bind to, but that doesn't exactly answer the
question.

While the ozone layer would be 3 mm thick if it was compressed down to the
pressure of earth's surface, since it is further up in the atmosphere, it can
take up a larger volume (like 20 km thick). The ozone layer is maintained by
the [ Chapman cycle ](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Chapman_mechanism) .

That is, the oxygen molecule (  $\ce{O_2}$  ) is dissociated by UV radiation
(photolysis) to oxygen atoms (  $\ce{2O}$  ). Then the photolyzed oxygen atoms
(  $\ce{2O}$  ) can bond with two oxygen molecules (  $\ce{2O_2}$  ) to make
an two ozone molecules (  $\ce{2O_3}$  ), provided another molecule can take
away some excess energy.

Since it is a cycle, there has to be a way for the ozone to return to oxygen.
One ozone molecule (  $\ce{O_3}$  ) can photolyze to make an oxygen atom (
$\ce{O}$  ) and oxygen molecule (  $\ce{O_2}$  ). The oxygen atom (  $\ce{O}$
) can react with another ozone molecule (  $\ce{O_3}$  ) to make two oxygen
molecules (  $\ce{2O_2}$  ).

To just answer your question directly, the ozone layer is replenished by the
sun's UV energy reacting with the oxygen in the atmosphere.","The ozone layer, situated primarily in the lower stratosphere between approximately 15 and 35 kilometers altitude, is a region characterized by a relatively high concentration of ozone (O₃) molecules, formed through photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O₂) by ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, which generates atomic oxygen that subsequently reacts with O₂ to produce O₃. The persistence of ozone at this altitude is governed by a dynamic equilibrium known as the Chapman cycle, where rates of ozone production and destruction—mediated by UV radiation and catalytic cycles involving naturally occurring and anthropogenic compounds such as nitrogen oxides, chlorine, and bromine—are balanced, preventing the gas from accumulating indefinitely or dissipating entirely. Ozone’s vertical distribution is maintained by atmospheric stratification, with the stratosphere exhibiting limited vertical mixing due to temperature inversion, which inhibits convective transport and allows ozone to remain concentrated in this layer rather than diffusing downward into the troposphere, where it is less stable and more rapidly destroyed by surface-level chemical reactions. The relatively low density and pressure at stratospheric altitudes, combined with the continuous input of solar UV radiation, sustain the photochemical processes necessary for ozone formation and maintenance, while gravitational settling is negligible due to the molecular scale and the mixing timescales of the atmosphere. The ozone layer’s average thickness, measured in Dobson Units (DU), reflects the integrated columnar abundance of ozone, and its apparent “layer” structure is a result of both the altitude-dependent photochemical production and the physical properties of the stratosphere, rather than a discrete, impermeable barrier.","The persistence of the ozone layer within the stratosphere, typically between 15 and 35 kilometers altitude, is governed by the photochemical equilibrium established through the Chapman cycle, wherein ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation dissociates molecular oxygen (O₂) to form atomic oxygen, which subsequently reacts with O₂ to produce ozone (O₃), while concurrent photolytic destruction and catalytic cycles involving trace gases (notably nitrogen oxides, chlorine, and bromine compounds) regulate its concentration. Ozone’s vertical distribution is a function of both its production rate—maximized where UV flux and molecular oxygen coexist optimally—and the balance of atmospheric dynamics, including stratospheric-tropospheric exchange, eddy diffusion, and large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation, which collectively maintain the ozone maximum at altitudes where photochemical production outpaces loss and downward mixing. The ozone layer does not constitute a discrete physical barrier but rather a region of enhanced ozone partial pressure, with the mean global columnar abundance quantified in Dobson Units (DU), where 300 DU corresponds to a 3-millimeter-thick layer at standard temperature and pressure, though in situ concentrations remain dilute due to the low stratospheric air density. Ozone’s apparent “stability” at these altitudes arises from the dynamic equilibrium between its continuous photochemical generation and destruction, modulated by solar insolation, atmospheric composition, and vertical transport processes, rather than any intrinsic property preventing its dissolution or gravitational settling. The stratospheric ozone layer’s altitude and persistence are thus emergent properties of atmospheric chemistry, radiative transfer, and global-scale circulation, rather than the result of a physical mechanism “holding” ozone in place."

Additionally, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ocean acidification, ocean circulation patterns, and the buffering capacity of different marine regions complicate the effectiveness and predictability of such geoengineering interventions. In summary, while there are ample limestone reserves to meet the theoretical demand for reversing ocean acidification via base addition, the technical, economic, and environmental complexities of mobilizing and deploying these resources at the required scale present formidable obstacles to practical implementation.","The feasibility of reversing ocean acidification through large-scale addition of a base such as sodium bicarbonate or, more commonly proposed, calcium carbonate (limestone), hinges on the global abundance, accessibility, and logistical mobilization of carbonate minerals, with global limestone reserves estimated in the tens of trillions of tonnes, far exceeding the multi-gigatonne annual quantities theoretically required for ocean alkalinity enhancement. The geochemical rationale is rooted in the carbonate buffering system, wherein dissolution of CaCO₃ increases ocean alkalinity, shifts the carbonate equilibrium, and enhances the ocean’s capacity to absorb atmospheric CO₂, thereby counteracting acidification; however, the dissolution kinetics, spatial heterogeneity of acidification, and potential ecological impacts of massive mineral addition must be rigorously evaluated. While terrestrial limestone deposits are widespread and extraction technologies are mature, the environmental footprint of mining, transportation, and dispersal at the gigatonne scale raises significant concerns regarding habitat disruption, carbon emissions from processing, and unintended biogeochemical consequences. Additionally, the solubility of limestone is limited in surface seawater due to supersaturation with respect to calcite and aragonite, necessitating either finely powdered material, deployment in undersaturated deep waters, or pre-treatment to enhance dissolution rates, all of which introduce further technical and economic complexities. Ultimately, while the sheer volume of global limestone reserves suggests material sufficiency for large-scale ocean alkalinity enhancement, the practical, environmental, and economic viability of such geoengineering interventions remains highly uncertain and necessitates comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment."

Yes two hurricanes/tropical cyclones/typhoons can merge with each other and
the effect is known as Fujiwhara effect- [ Fujiwhara effect
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwhara_effect) .

The National Weather Service defines the Fujiwhara effect as ""Binary
Interaction where tropical cyclones within a certain distance(300-375 nautical
miles depending on the size of the cyclones) of each other begin to rotate
about a common midpoint"". What really happens is that centers of both systems
begin to orbit in a counter clockwise direction about a midpoint that is
determined by the relative mass and cyclone intensity. Eventually the smaller
cyclone may merge into the larger cyclone. There are several examples of the
Fujiwhara effect and one example would be Hurricane Connie [ Hurricane Connie
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Connie) and Diane [ Hurricane Diane
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Diane) way back in 1955. Shimokawa
et al [ Fujiwhara Effect Types ](http://dil-
opac.bosai.go.jp/publication/nied_natural_disaster/pdf/45/45-02E.pdf) talk
about the various kinds of interactions that can take place among various
typhoons(Please note that the Fujiwhara effect is not restricted to two
systems). The various kinds of interactions are

  * Complete Merger 
  * Partial Merger 
  * Complete Straining Out 
  * Partial Straining Out 
  * Elastic Straining Out 

Complete straining and complete merger interactions lead to destruction of one
of the vortices. Partial merger and partial straining lead to partial
destruction of one vortex and elastic straining is an interaction in which
both vortices survive with their initial circulation. Partial merger and
partial straining out have received less attention in the literature on binary
tropical cyclone interactions as the interactions are extremely complex.
Prieto et al claim that during a partial merger repeated mass exchanges occur
between vortices. As these are nonlinear effects a quantification is only
possible by a direct numerical integration and precise initial condition [
Binary TC Vortex Like Interactions
](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%282003%29131%3C2656%3AACOBTC%3E2.0.CO%3B2)

The period of orbit maybe as small as one day or there are others such as
Cyclone Kathy and Cyclone Marie [ Kathy/Marie Fujiwhara
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Pacific_typhoon_season#Typhoon_Marie_.28Undang.29)
orbited for a period of 5 days prior to merging into each other as pointed out
by [ Lander et al
](http://twister.ou.edu/QJ/CD3-1990-1995/1993/v119n514/s5.pdf?origin=publication_detail)
. If the period of orbit is longer then there is a greater probability of a
merger.

Region wise binary cyclones are more common in the Western North Pacific than
the North Atlantic as pointed by Dong et al [ Relative Motion Of Binary
Tropical Cyclones
](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281983%29111%3C0945%3AOTRMOB%3E2.0.CO%3B2)
Regarding the predictability of the track of binary cyclones Dong et al. state
that prediction of steering forces of a single tropical cyclone are replete
with numerical forecasting uncertainties and the problem is accentuated by the
presence of another tropical cyclone in close proximity. Those who followed
the progress of Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 (an instance of the
Fujiwhara effect but in this case a tropical cyclone merged with an extra
tropical storm) will remember the ECMWF model correctly predicted the landfall
location.","The phenomenon of two large cyclonic systems interacting is known as the Fujiwhara effect, wherein the circulations of two nearby cyclones (such as hurricanes, typhoons, or extratropical cyclones) begin to orbit around a common center, potentially leading to either mutual repulsion, absorption, or, in rare cases, partial or complete merger. Historical records indicate that full mergers of intense tropical cyclones are exceedingly rare due to the disruptive wind shear and asymmetrical inflow generated during close proximity, which typically causes one storm to weaken or be absorbed by the other rather than forming a single, more powerful storm; notable examples include the partial merger of Typhoon Parma and Typhoon Melor in 2009 and the interaction of Hurricane Hilary and Hurricane Irwin in 2017, both of which resulted in complex structural changes but not a doubling of intensity. In extratropical regions, cyclonic mergers are more common, often resulting in a process called ""cyclone phase locking"" or ""binary cyclone merger,"" which can produce a larger, sometimes more intense storm system, as seen in the 1993 ""Storm of the Century"" in the North Atlantic. The underlying dynamics involve the conservation of angular momentum, vorticity interactions, and the redistribution of energy, with the outcome dependent on the relative sizes, intensities, and separation distances of the interacting systems. While the low-pressure centers of cyclones can attract each other due to pressure gradients, the complex interplay of outflow, wind shear, and environmental steering currents usually prevents a simple additive effect on storm intensity, and instead, the interaction often leads to structural disruption, asymmetric rainfall distribution, or the dominance of one vortex over the other.","The phenomenon of two large cyclonic systems, such as hurricanes or typhoons, interacting is known as the Fujiwhara effect, wherein their respective cyclonic circulations induce mutual rotation around a common centroid, but true merger into a single, more powerful storm is exceedingly rare, particularly for mature tropical cyclones. Historical records, including satellite-era observations, indicate that while binary interaction and partial absorption (where one storm dominates and absorbs the other) have occurred—such as with Typhoon Parma and Melor (2009) or Hurricane Hilary and Irwin (2017)—full-scale coalescence into a singular, dramatically intensified system has not been conclusively documented for tropical cyclones, as the complex interplay of angular momentum, vorticity, and environmental shear typically leads to disruption, weakening, or asymmetric absorption rather than constructive amalgamation. In extratropical or midlatitude contexts, cyclogenesis can involve the merger of multiple low-pressure systems, a process termed ""cyclone phase merging,"" which can yield larger, more intense extratropical cyclones, but the dynamics differ fundamentally from tropical cyclone interactions due to baroclinic instability and frontal processes. Theoretically, the low-pressure centers of adjacent storms could attract each other via pressure gradient forces, but the intricate balance of Coriolis force, environmental steering flow, and outflow interactions often results in mutual interference, structural deformation, or even dissipation rather than synergistic intensification. Thus, while the concept of two hurricanes merging to become ""twice as powerful"" is not supported by empirical evidence or dynamical modeling, the Fujiwhara effect and related binary interactions remain critical in understanding the evolution, track deviation, and intensity modulation of cyclonic systems in both tropical and extratropical regimes."

There's a little more to it than its substantial age, but not a lot.

First, a bit of background. We need a few conditions for accumulations of oil
or gas:

  * A [ kerogen ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerogen) -rich source rock that has been 'cooked' to thermal maturity. Insufficient temperature, or insufficient time, and it's undercooked; if the temperature is too high, or the rock is very old, then the volatiles have all been discharged or cracked. I don't know of any source rocks older than about Ordovician; the best ones are Jurassic in age. 
  * A migration pathway from the source to a trapping configuration, and time for this to have happened. 
  * A [ structural ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_trap) or stratigraphic trap, such as an anticline, and the geological conditions that have preserved it since filling. 
  * A reservoir rock — a porous and permeable rock. Usually this is a sedimentary rock, though hydrocarbons have been discovered in fractured granites (in Vietnam for example; this is rare). 

Only 'conventional' hydrocarbon deposits need all these conditions (sometimes
called a [ 'petroleum system' ](http://subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Petroleum_system)
, such as you might find in the North Sea). 'Shale gas' is basically just a
mature source rock — we can extract hydrocarbons from it by fracking, for
example.

As you might guess from the list of conditions, there are lots of things that
can destroy a hydrocarbon accumulation, or preclude its formation. For
example, deep burial destroys porosity by diagenesis and compaction. Time
increases the likelihood of trap leakage or thermal destruction of volatiles.

So, why no hydrocarbons in the (mostly Precambrian) Swedish-Norwegian shield?
Maybe these are the top 3 reasons:

  * These old rocks never had a good source rock: too old, too little life. A bad start. 
  * They are so old that any source would have been mature hundreds of millions of years ago. 
  * In any case, metamorphosis has destroyed any potential reservoirs, and a combination of tectonism, orogenesis, and exhumation has destroyed any traps.","The western Sveconorwegian belt of the Fennoscandian Shield, predominantly comprising high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks of Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic age, lacks significant hydrocarbon deposits primarily due to its tectonothermal history, which involved intense orogenic events, high-grade regional metamorphism (amphibolite to granulite facies), and widespread anatexis, all of which obliterated any pre-existing sedimentary basins and organic matter necessary for hydrocarbon generation and preservation. The region's crustal evolution, characterized by the Gothian and subsequent Sveconorwegian orogenies, resulted in extensive deformation, uplift, and erosion, further precluding the development and preservation of suitable source rocks, reservoirs, and sealing units typical of hydrocarbon systems. Additionally, the absence of unmetamorphosed, organic-rich sedimentary sequences and the prevalence of crystalline basement rocks mean that the essential petroleum system elements—source, reservoir, and seal—are fundamentally missing or have been destroyed. The tectonic stability and exposure of ancient shield rocks, coupled with a lack of post-orogenic sedimentary cover, contrast sharply with hydrocarbon-rich Phanerozoic basins, where burial, preservation, and maturation of organic matter are feasible. Thus, the geological evolution, lithological composition, and tectonothermal regime of the western Sveconorwegian belt collectively preclude the presence of exploitable hydrocarbon resources, independent of its Gothian origins.","The Sveconorwegian belt, constituting the southwestern margin of the Fennoscandian Shield, is a Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic orogenic province characterized by high-grade metamorphic rocks, extensive anatexis, and pervasive ductile deformation, resulting from prolonged tectonothermal events between approximately 1.14 and 0.90 Ga. The region's lithological assemblages predominantly comprise granulite- to amphibolite-facies gneisses, migmatites, and granitoid intrusions, with a near-complete absence of unmetamorphosed sedimentary basins or preserved Phanerozoic cover sequences, which are essential for the generation, maturation, and entrapment of hydrocarbons. The tectonometamorphic history of the Sveconorwegian belt, including deep crustal reworking, high-grade metamorphism, and repeated magmatic intrusions, would have obliterated any pre-existing organic-rich sedimentary rocks, precluding the preservation of potential source rocks and the development of viable reservoir-seal pairs. Furthermore, the region's Proterozoic crustal architecture, dominated by crystalline basement rocks of Gothian and Sveconorwegian affinity, lacks the requisite stratigraphic and structural traps, as well as the burial history necessary for the thermal maturation of organic matter into hydrocarbons. Consequently, the absence of hydrocarbon deposits in the western Sveconorwegian belt is fundamentally attributable to its protracted high-grade metamorphic evolution, lack of post-orogenic sedimentary cover, and the absence of both source and reservoir rocks, rather than solely its Gothian protoliths."

[ Atmospheric escape ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape) is
the loss of planetary atmospheric gases to outer space. You'd never be able to
contain ALL of any gas forever by gravity. Ultimately you end up in the
rarefied atmosphere where there is some probability that a molecule of gas
will reach escape velocity. The probability distribution is given by the [
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution) and
the thermal escape mechanism is known as the [ Jeans escape
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Thermal_escape_mechanisms)
.

On earth the problem is compounded by the fact that helium is lighter that the
other gases. So (1) helium migrates to the upper atmosphere because of its
density and (2) helium atoms on average have the same kinetic energy as oxygen
and nitrogen molecules which means that helium atoms are on average traveling
much faster than oxygen or nitrogen molecules.

All of this is made more complicated by needing a temperature profile of the
atmosphere as a function of the height.

It doesn't help to assume temperature of background radiation because even at
that temperature you can calculate the probability of a helium atom having 80%
of light speed. This sort of like being able to calculate the probability of
throwing $n$ heads in a row regardless of how big $n$ is.","The ability of a planet to retain a particular gas in its atmosphere depends on the planet’s escape velocity, the molecular mass of the gas, and the temperature of the upper atmosphere, with lighter gases like helium (atomic mass 4 u) and hydrogen (2 u) being most susceptible to thermal escape via Jeans escape and hydrodynamic escape mechanisms. For a planet to retain helium over geological timescales, its escape velocity must be sufficiently high that the average thermal velocity of helium atoms at the exobase (upper atmosphere) is significantly less than one-sixth of the escape velocity, a criterion derived from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the concept of critical velocity for atmospheric retention. Earth’s escape velocity (11.2 km/s) is insufficient to retain helium at typical exospheric temperatures (~1000 K), whereas a planet would need to be approximately 6 times Earth’s mass (with proportional increase in radius, assuming similar density) to achieve an escape velocity high enough (~19–20 km/s) to prevent significant helium loss, a value comparable to Uranus (14.5 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses), both of which retain substantial helium and hydrogen atmospheres. In contrast, Saturn (95 Earth masses) and Jupiter (318 Earth masses) have much higher escape velocities and thus easily retain all light gases, explaining their hydrogen-helium dominated atmospheres. Therefore, for Earth to retain helium efficiently, it would need to be at least 6–10 times its current mass, with atmospheric retention characteristics approaching those of the ice giants, and the precise threshold depends on atmospheric temperature, solar EUV flux, and planetary magnetic field effects on atmospheric escape processes.","The retention of helium in a planetary atmosphere is governed by the balance between the planet’s gravitational escape velocity and the thermal velocities of helium atoms, as described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the concept of Jeans escape, where lighter gases like helium and hydrogen exceed the escape velocity at typical exospheric temperatures and are lost to space over geological timescales. For Earth, with a mass of approximately 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg and an escape velocity of 11.2 km/s, the mean thermal velocity of helium at the exobase (~1000 K) is sufficient for a significant fraction of atoms to escape, whereas a planet would require an escape velocity at least six times greater than the mean thermal speed of helium to retain it efficiently over billions of years. Quantitative analysis indicates that Earth would need to be roughly 6 to 10 times more massive, corresponding to an escape velocity in the range of 20–30 km/s, to prevent substantial helium loss, placing the threshold between the masses of Earth and the ice giants—Neptune (17 Earth masses, 23.5 km/s escape velocity) and Uranus (14.5 Earth masses, 21.3 km/s)—which retain significant primordial helium. This mass threshold is a function not only of planetary mass but also of atmospheric temperature, exospheric conditions, and the presence of a magnetic field, all of which influence the rate of thermal and non-thermal escape processes such as hydrodynamic escape, charge exchange, and polar wind outflow. Therefore, a planet with a mass and escape velocity comparable to or exceeding those of Uranus or Neptune, rather than merely two or five times Earth’s mass, would be required to gravitationally retain helium in its atmosphere over geological timescales, illustrating why terrestrial planets like Earth are depleted in light noble gases while gas and ice giants maintain helium-rich envelopes."

**Update:** [ This article ](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-study-solves-
two-mysteries-about-wobbling-earth) on some new research in this field is
worth a read.","The orientation of Earth's rotation axis relative to its surface, known as true polar wander (TPW), can indeed change over geological timescales due to the redistribution of mass within the planet, such as mantle convection, glacial isostatic adjustment, or large-scale volcanic activity, though these processes typically cause only gradual shifts of a few degrees over millions of years. Sudden events like massive earthquakes can cause minor, transient changes in Earth's moment of inertia and thus slightly alter the position of the geographic poles, but these are minuscule—on the order of centimeters to meters—and do not result in significant reorientation of the axis itself. The geographic North Pole, defined by the intersection of Earth's rotational axis with its surface, could theoretically migrate to a new location (e.g., Greenland) only through a dramatic true polar wander event, which would require a colossal redistribution of mass, far exceeding the effects of typical tectonic or seismic activity, and is not observed in the current geological epoch. In contrast, axial precession and nutation refer to the slow, cyclical wobbling of the axis in space, not its position relative to Earth's surface, while tectonic drift and continental movement involve the lithosphere moving over the mantle, not the axis itself moving relative to the crust. Thus, while Earth's inner dynamics can induce minor, gradual changes in the orientation of the rotation axis relative to the surface (true polar wander), only cataclysmic events such as giant impacts or extraordinary mantle flow could cause the geographic pole to shift dramatically, a phenomenon not currently supported by observational evidence for the present era.","The orientation of Earth's rotation axis relative to its surface, known as true polar wander (TPW), can indeed change over geological timescales, distinct from precession, nutation, or tectonic plate motion, and is driven by large-scale redistribution of mass within the planet, such as mantle convection, glacial isostatic adjustment, or significant volcanic outpourings, which alter the planet's moment of inertia. While earthquakes and internal dynamics like mantle plume activity can induce minor, transient shifts in Earth's instantaneous rotation axis—termed polar motion—these are typically on the order of centimeters to meters and do not result in wholesale relocation of the geographic poles. For the geographic North Pole to migrate to a location such as Greenland, a colossal reorganization of Earth's mass distribution would be required, far exceeding the capabilities of endogenous processes under current geodynamic regimes, and is more plausibly associated with catastrophic exogenic events like large asteroid impacts or hypothesized ""true polar wander"" episodes in Earth's deep past. The Chandler wobble and annual wobble are examples of short-term, quasi-periodic variations in the pole's position, but these do not constitute a permanent shift in the axis' orientation relative to the crust. In summary, while Earth's internal processes can induce minor, transient changes in the orientation of the rotation axis (polar motion), only massive, global-scale mass redistributions—rare in Earth's history—can drive true polar wander sufficient to relocate the geographic poles, and such events are not observed in the context of typical mantle or seismic activity."

The value -999 is likely the ""fill value"" used in the dataset when data is
missing or is not being properly filtered or handled when displayed. In the

It isn't a physical value and only means the value is missing. Furthermore,
-999°C is not a possible value because [ absolute zero

This phenomenon is known as [ global dimming
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming) .

It was due to the particles and aerosols mostly released by combustion of
fossil fuels such as diesel. Those particles block the radiation from the sun,
so they have a cooling effect. For some decades this effect counterbalanced
the warming effect of greenhouse gases, although it is no longer the case at a
global scale (see for instance [ Wild et al. 2007
](https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028031) ). Particles emission has been reduced
thanks to better engines and new regulations, which stopped their masking
effect on global warming. Which is a good thing since those particles have a
serious impact on health.","Between 1950 and 1980, global mean surface temperature anomalies were slightly negative or near zero despite increasing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to the masking effect of anthropogenic aerosols—especially sulfate aerosols—emitted from coal and oil combustion, which increased atmospheric albedo and induced global dimming by reflecting incoming solar radiation. The post-World War II economic boom led to rapid industrialization and a surge in emissions of both greenhouse gases and particulate matter, but the short atmospheric lifetime and strong cooling effect of aerosols temporarily offset the long-term warming influence of accumulating carbon dioxide. This period coincided with a lack of stringent air quality regulations, resulting in high concentrations of aerosols, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, which suppressed temperature rise despite the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases. Additionally, natural variability, such as the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and relatively low solar activity, may have contributed to the muted warming or slight cooling observed in global temperature records during these decades. The subsequent implementation of clean air policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s reduced aerosol emissions, diminishing their cooling effect and allowing the underlying greenhouse gas-induced warming trend to become more apparent in the following decades.","The negative global temperature anomalies observed between 1950 and 1980, despite substantial cumulative anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion and associated CO₂ emissions since the late 19th century, are primarily attributed to the concurrent increase in atmospheric aerosols, particularly sulfate aerosols, resulting from post-World War II industrialization and the absence of effective emission controls. These aerosols exert a net negative radiative forcing by scattering incoming solar radiation (direct effect) and modifying cloud albedo and lifetime (indirect effect), thereby offsetting the greenhouse warming signal from rising greenhouse gas concentrations during this period. The temporal lag in global mean surface temperature response is further compounded by oceanic thermal inertia and internal climate variability, including multidecadal oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which can modulate the expression of anthropogenic warming on decadal timescales. The subsequent implementation of air quality regulations, such as the Clean Air Acts in the United States and Europe during the 1970s, led to a reduction in aerosol emissions, diminishing their cooling influence and allowing the underlying greenhouse gas-induced warming trend to dominate from the 1980s onward. Thus, the mid-20th century temperature plateau or slight cooling is best understood as a transient phase resulting from the complex interplay between anthropogenic aerosol loading, greenhouse gas accumulation, and natural climate variability, rather than a simple function of cumulative fossil fuel consumption."
"We know that plates can subduct, causing one plate to be pushed into the core by another. As the plates move, the subduction continues, pushing one plate under the other.

Excellent question! Indeed, entire plates have subducted before.

One example is the Intermontane Plate ( [ Wikipedia
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermontane_Plate) ). This plate sat west of
North America around 195 million years ago. The plate contained a chain of
volcanic islands on its western edge (known as the [ Intermontane Islands
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermontane_Islands) ). As the plate
subducted under the North American plate, that island chain stood too tall and
merged with the North American plate.

The entire Intermontane Plate was subducted under the North American plate.
However, we are able to see the remnants of the plate in the volcanic islands
it left behind.

Once this Intermontane Plate was subducted, the Insular Plate became the new
subduction zone.

This entire process was actually repeated with the Insular Plate, subducting
the entire plate, leaving behind yet another chain of volcanic islands that
fused to the western coast of the North American Plate.

Well worth the read.","Subduction is a fundamental process of plate tectonics in which one lithospheric plate is forced beneath another at convergent boundaries, typically resulting in the recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle; over geologic time, entire oceanic plates such as the Farallon Plate and the ancient Iapetus Ocean plate have been almost completely subducted beneath continental plates, as evidenced by the disappearance of ocean basins and the presence of suture zones and orogenic belts. Geological and geophysical evidence for complete or near-complete subduction includes seismic tomography revealing subducted slab remnants (""slab graveyards"") in the mantle, paleomagnetic and stratigraphic records indicating closure of ancient oceans, and the presence of ophiolites and high-pressure metamorphic rocks (e.g., blueschist, eclogite) accreted to continental margins.

Plate reconstructions using paleogeographic, paleomagnetic, and geochronological data, as well as the identification of extinct subduction zones and accreted terranes, provide further evidence for the complete subduction of plates. Thus, the geological record, mantle tomography, and plate tectonic reconstructions collectively demonstrate that entire plates have been subducted and consumed, leaving behind only indirect geophysical and geological signatures.","Subduction is a fundamental process in plate tectonics wherein an oceanic lithospheric plate converges with another plate—typically continental or younger, less dense oceanic lithosphere—and is forced beneath it into the asthenosphere, ultimately recycling crustal material into the mantle.

The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the total energy released,
therefore to estimate it from a seismogram you need to know the distance to
the source. In the case of the [ Richter scale
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) for example, the
relationship between magnitude and seismogram amplitude is defined for a
standard distance.

If you have only one seismograph, you can not triangulate the location of the
source ( [ hypocenter ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocenter) ).
Therefore, you can not estimate the magnitude of a seismic event (Richter or [

**But you can estimate the[ local seismic intensity

You might want to have a look at [ this question
](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/4681/characterizing-
earthquakes-using-accelerometer-data) . There are some nice answers and
references that you might find useful.","The ADXL345 accelerometer, when interfaced with a Raspberry Pi for seismographic applications, provides raw triaxial acceleration data (in g or m/s²), which can be processed to estimate ground motion during seismic events. To express this data in terms of earthquake magnitude, such as the Richter scale (local magnitude, ML), one must first convert the peak ground acceleration (PGA) from the sensor into an equivalent ground velocity or displacement, often using numerical integration or empirical relationships, since the Richter scale is logarithmic and based on maximum amplitude of seismic waves recorded by a standard Wood-Anderson seismograph at a specific distance. The conversion from acceleration to magnitude is inherently imprecise due to differences in sensor response, frequency content, site effects, and the fact that the Richter scale is calibrated for specific instrument and distance conditions, but approximate relationships exist, such as ML ≈ log10(A) + correction factors, where A is the maximum amplitude in micrometers at a given distance. For more robust magnitude estimation, modern seismology often uses moment magnitude (Mw) or other intensity scales, which require additional parameters like seismic moment, rupture area, or energy release, generally not directly accessible from a single accelerometer without further geophysical modeling. To implement a magnitude estimation pipeline, one would preprocess the ADXL345 data to filter noise, compute vector magnitude of acceleration, identify seismic events, extract maximum amplitude, correct for instrument and site response, estimate source distance if possible, and apply empirical or theoretical formulas to approximate local magnitude, recognizing the limitations and uncertainties inherent in such a DIY setup.","The ADXL345 accelerometer, when interfaced with a Raspberry Pi for seismographic applications, provides triaxial acceleration data that can be leveraged to estimate ground motion parameters, but direct translation to earthquake magnitude—such as the Richter (local magnitude, ML) or moment magnitude (Mw) scales—requires careful consideration of seismological principles and instrument limitations. Earthquake magnitude scales are fundamentally logarithmic measures of seismic energy release, typically derived from the amplitude of ground displacement or velocity recorded at standardized distances from the hypocenter, and corrected for attenuation and local site effects, whereas the ADXL345 outputs raw acceleration (in g or m/s²) at a single, non-standardized location, lacking the dynamic range and sensitivity of professional broadband seismometers. To approximate a local magnitude at the sensor site, one could compute the peak ground acceleration (PGA) from the vector sum of the three axes, then apply empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) or attenuation relationships that relate PGA to magnitude and distance, though this introduces significant uncertainties due to unknown source-to-sensor distance, focal depth, and local amplification effects. Alternatively, by integrating the acceleration data to obtain ground velocity or displacement, and referencing calibration curves or published seismological relationships, a rough estimate of equivalent local magnitude can be inferred, but this process is highly sensitive to sensor noise, baseline drift, and the frequency response of the ADXL345, which is not optimized for low-frequency seismic signals. Ultimately, while it is feasible to express sensed ground motion in terms of a proxy magnitude using the aforementioned methodologies, the resulting values should be interpreted as qualitative or order-of-magnitude estimates rather than precise seismological measurements, and any such conversion should be accompanied by explicit caveats regarding the limitations of consumer-grade MEMS accelerometers in quantitative earthquake magnitude determination."

When these energetic particles collide with atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere, predominantly oxygen and nitrogen, they excite these atmospheric constituents, causing them to emit photons at characteristic wavelengths, producing the vivid green, red, blue, and purple lights observed in auroral displays. The spatial distribution and intensity of auroras are governed by geomagnetic field lines, which concentrate particle precipitation in oval-shaped regions around the magnetic poles, known as auroral ovals, whose size and position fluctuate with geomagnetic activity and solar wind conditions. The differences between the northern and southern lights arise from asymmetries in the Earth's magnetic field, variations in the solar wind, and differences in the underlying geography and atmospheric conditions at each pole, which can affect the visibility, intensity, and morphology of auroral displays.

The spatial and temporal distribution of auroras is governed by geomagnetic activity, solar wind velocity, and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, with geomagnetic storms and substorms intensifying auroral activity and expanding the auroral oval equatorward. The distinction between the northern and southern lights arises from asymmetries in the Earth's magnetic field, differences in the distribution of landmasses and oceans, and variations in ionospheric conductivity, which can cause disparities in auroral morphology, intensity, and frequency between the two hemispheres, despite their general conjugacy. Additionally, the tilt and offset of the geomagnetic axis relative to the rotational axis, as well as seasonal variations in solar illumination and atmospheric composition, further modulate the visibility and characteristics of auroras at high latitudes.

Key rifting events include the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean between North America and northwest Africa, the South Atlantic rift between South America and Africa (final separation ~120–100 million years ago), and the later breakup of Gondwana into Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the last major land connections persisting between Antarctica and Australia until the Eocene (~35 million years ago) and between Antarctica and South America via the Scotia Arc until the Oligocene (~23 million years ago).

Writing about the San Francisco Bay salt ponds, [ Dr R. J. Rusay notes

Rusay says nothing about the Saloum Delta, but the explanation could be
similar there.","The strikingly varied colours of the salt pits in the Saloum Delta, Senegal, arise from a complex interplay of halophilic microorganisms (notably Dunaliella salina and halobacteria), fluctuating salinity gradients, mineralogical composition, and differential light absorption and reflection. High salinity levels foster the proliferation of carotenoid-rich microalgae such as Dunaliella salina, which impart vivid pink, red, or orange hues due to their beta-carotene content, while halophilic archaea contribute reddish or purplish tones through bacteriorhodopsin pigments. Variations in mineral content, particularly iron oxides and gypsum, further modulate the chromatic spectrum, introducing white, yellow, or brownish tints depending on the concentration and oxidation state of these minerals. Seasonal changes in evaporation rates, water depth, and temperature alter the physicochemical environment, influencing both microbial community structure and pigment production, thereby generating dynamic and spatially heterogeneous colour patterns. Additionally, anthropogenic factors such as salt harvesting practices can expose underlying sediments or concentrate brines, further accentuating the visual diversity of the salt pans in the Saloum Delta.","The strikingly varied colours of the salt pits in the Saloum Delta, Senegal, arise from a complex interplay of hypersaline conditions, microbial activity, mineral precipitation, and fluctuating physicochemical parameters such as salinity, pH, and temperature. High evaporation rates in the delta's shallow pans concentrate dissolved ions, particularly sodium and chloride, leading to halite precipitation and fostering extreme halophilic microbial communities, including Dunaliella salina and Halobacteria, which produce carotenoid pigments (notably beta-carotene and bacterioruberin) responsible for vivid pink, red, and orange hues. Variations in brine chemistry, such as magnesium, sulfate, and calcium concentrations, further modulate mineral assemblages, occasionally resulting in the deposition of gypsum or other evaporites, which can impart white or greyish tones. Seasonal hydrological fluctuations, including freshwater influx during the rainy season and increased evaporation during the dry season, dynamically alter the ionic composition and stratification of the brine, influencing both microbial population dynamics and mineral precipitation pathways. The resultant chromatic diversity thus reflects the integrated effects of biogeochemical cycling, extremophile adaptation, and evaporitic mineralogy within the unique geomorphological and climatic context of the Saloum Delta."
"Methane clathrates are

Current geophysical and geochemical assessments suggest that the global inventory of methane hydrates ranges from 500 to 10,000 gigatons of carbon (GtC), with continental permafrost-associated hydrates representing a smaller but still substantial fraction, often cited in the range of 20 to 120 GtC, though these estimates remain highly uncertain due to limited direct sampling and complex subsurface heterogeneity. The occurrence and stability of these continental methane clathrates are governed by factors such as geothermal gradients, sediment porosity and permeability, organic matter availability, and the thickness and continuity of permafrost, which together define the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) in terrestrial settings. The potential destabilization of these hydrates due to anthropogenic warming and permafrost thaw poses significant implications for atmospheric methane fluxes, positive climate feedbacks, and geohazard risks such as subsidence and slope failure. Ongoing research employs seismic surveys, well logging, and geochemical modeling to refine volumetric estimates and assess the potential for both energy resource utilization and environmental impact from these continental methane hydrate deposits."
"Supervolcanos have occurred in the recent geological past, but not within the past 74,000 years. Is it possible to find the magma chambers with no previous history of supervolcanic activity that are likely to produce supervolcanos?","To find the magma chambers which produces super volcanals, use the method of seismic tomography.

I am a seismologist, not a volcanologist, but we can use a method called
seismic tomography to understand the size of magma chambers.

This method is similar to a medical CT scan - the magma mush will have a
slower seismic wavespeed than the surrounding 'normal' rock. Therefore, we can
use this to determine the size of magma chambers from a tomographic image.

Even if a volcano does not appear to be active at the surface, it could still
overlie a magmatic anomaly.

This approach was recently used to estimate the seismic of the Yellowstone
magmatic body. See this paper: [

Seismic tomography can theoretically be applied to any region, but we just
need to have enough seismic sources nearby (e.g. earthquakes) to be able to do
this accurately.","Supervolcanoes, defined as volcanic centers capable of producing eruptions with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 8 or higher, have occurred in the Quaternary period, with the most recent being the Toba eruption (~74,000 years ago), and their identification relies on recognizing large, silicic magma chambers, extensive caldera systems, and geophysical anomalies such as low seismic velocities and high heat flow. Detecting potential supervolcano sites without prior eruptive history involves integrating geophysical imaging (e.g., seismic tomography, magnetotellurics), petrological analysis of crustal melts, and geochemical signatures indicative of voluminous, evolved magma reservoirs at shallow crustal depths. The absence of surface volcanic features or historical eruptions complicates prediction, but crustal deformation, persistent hydrothermal activity, and anomalous gas emissions (e.g., elevated CO₂ or SO₂ flux) may signal the presence of large, unerupted magma bodies. Advances in remote sensing, gravity surveys, and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) allow for the detection of subtle ground deformation and density anomalies, which, when combined with tectonic context (e.g., continental rift zones, subduction-related arcs, or hotspots), can highlight regions at risk for future supervolcanic activity. However, the rarity of supereruptions, the long repose intervals, and the incomplete understanding of the triggers for catastrophic magma chamber destabilization limit the predictive accuracy for identifying new, previously unrecognized supervolcano candidates.","The identification of potential future supervolcano sites without a documented history of supereruption necessitates the integration of geophysical, geochemical, and petrological methodologies to detect and characterize large, silicic magma reservoirs within the upper crust, typically exceeding 450 km³ in eruptible melt volume, which is the threshold for VEI-8 events. Advanced seismic tomography, magnetotelluric imaging, and gravity anomaly mapping are employed to delineate low-velocity zones, high-conductivity regions, and density deficits indicative of partially molten, volatile-rich magma bodies, while geochemical analyses of hydrothermal fluids and volcanic gases, particularly elevated concentrations of CO₂, SO₂, and helium isotopic ratios, can signal active magmatic degassing from deep, evolving reservoirs. The absence of a supereruption record at a given site does not preclude future supervolcanic potential, as the recurrence interval for such events often exceeds the preservation span of the geologic record, and many large caldera systems may have cryptic or deeply buried eruptive histories. Tectonic settings conducive to supervolcano formation, such as continental hotspots, subduction-related volcanic arcs with thickened crust, and extensional back-arc environments, are prioritized for surveillance, with particular attention to regions exhibiting persistent uplift, anomalous heat flow, and extensive silicic volcanism. Ultimately, probabilistic hazard assessment for nascent supervolcanoes requires the synthesis of crustal melt fraction estimates, volatile saturation states, magma recharge rates, and thermomechanical modeling to evaluate the likelihood of catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions in systems lacking prior supervolcanic activity."

The magnetic field is always changing - a ""pulse"" is a quicker-than-normal

A ""jerk"" is a quick change (few months) of the rate at which magnetic field
changes at Earth's surface, making something like a 'V' shape if you plot the
field against time at a given location.

The idea is that a pulse occurs at the core, and jerks are an effect seen at
the surface just before and after the peak of the pulse, as the field change
ramps up and down. _The underlying cause of this is not known_ , and we only

This phenomenon is attributed to complex, dynamic processes within the Earth's outer core, specifically involving hydromagnetic waves and torsional oscillations in the liquid iron alloy, which modulate the flow patterns and induce localized, transient accelerations in the geodynamo responsible for generating the geomagnetic field.

"What parts of the fossil record are most lacking in specimens? That is, if you were to trace the evolution of a modern mammal (humans, for example) from abiogenesis to now, which periods are the most lacking in fossils?

The biggest temporal gap would be (IMO) the Precambrian, specifically pre-
Ediacarian. Accordingly the biggest gap in the evolutionary history is the
origin of eukaryots, both because of the paucity of pre-Ediacarian formations
but also because few of the early protists were likely to be fossilizable.

From the probable apparition of life ca. 3.8-3.5 Ga (e. g. **1** for a review
of Archean fossils) to the Ediacarian (ca. 600 Ma) in which metazoans (i. e.
""animals"") are already diverse (e. g. **2** ), this is more than 3 Ga of life
history for which we have very little fossils (though our knowledge of this

The Proterozoic Eon, especially prior to the Ediacaran Period, is marked by a paucity of multicellular fossils, resulting in significant gaps in our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotes, the origin of multicellularity, and the early divergence of major eukaryotic lineages. The Cambrian Explosion provides a relatively rich fossil record for the rapid diversification of animal phyla, but subsequent periods such as the early Paleozoic and the transition from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates (e.g., the Devonian) are characterized by notable gaps, particularly in the origin and early evolution of tetrapods and amniotes.

For hominin evolution, although the Pliocene and Pleistocene are relatively well-sampled, there remain substantial gaps in the Miocene fossil record, obscuring the origins and early diversification of hominids and the emergence of the genus Homo, with additional challenges posed by taphonomic biases, geographic sampling limitations, and the rarity of transitional forms.","The fossil record exhibits profound taphonomic and stratigraphic biases, with the most significant gaps occurring in the Precambrian, particularly the Hadean and early Archean eons, where evidence for abiogenesis and the earliest prokaryotic life is almost entirely absent due to high-grade metamorphism, subduction, and lack of sedimentary preservation. The Proterozoic Eon, despite yielding some stromatolitic and microfossil evidence, remains sparse in well-preserved eukaryotic and multicellular fossils, creating a substantial lacuna in tracing the origins and early diversification of complex life. The transition from non-avian dinosaurs to early mammals across the Mesozoic–Cenozoic boundary is relatively well-documented, but the early Cenozoic, particularly the Paleocene, is characterized by a dearth of transitional mammalian fossils, complicating phylogenetic reconstruction of modern mammalian lineages, including primates. Within the hominin lineage, the interval between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees (estimated at 5–7 million years ago) and the appearance of definitive Australopithecus remains fragmentary, with few well-preserved specimens bridging key morphological and behavioral transitions. Overall, the most pronounced discontinuities in the fossil record relevant to modern mammal evolution are found in the Precambrian (especially pre-Ediacaran), the early Paleogene, and the basal hominin record, reflecting both preservation biases and episodic sedimentary hiatuses."
"Okay, so I believe that most of the impact/collisions happen at oblique angles to the planet's radial direction. (I am not very sure about this, but since it is not a freefall, we can assume that the collision is oblique).

So why are most of the craters radially symmetric?

Why isn't the depression skewed?

I have almost never come across a photograph of a skewed crater.",The post wants to find out why the impact craters are symmetric. It's due to the explosion when happening. ,43,['N/A'],['symmetric_crater/Impact_crater.txt'],"['symmetric_crater/Impact_crater4.txt'
 'symmetric_crater/Impact_crater3.txt']","$\begingroup$

The main reason why impact craters are close to symmetrically round is because
it's the explosion of the impactor, not its collision, that creates the impact
crater. The impactor is travelling so fast that, rather than simply exploding
on impact, it burrows deep into the collision site, heats up from compression
and friction, and explodes deep underground, thus creating a more-or-less
perfectly round crater.","Most planetary impact craters are radially symmetric because the hypervelocity nature of most impacts (typically exceeding several kilometers per second) causes the kinetic energy of the impactor to be rapidly converted into a shock wave that propagates isotropically from the point of contact, regardless of the impact angle, as long as it exceeds approximately 10–15 degrees from the horizontal. The transient crater formation process is dominated by the explosive excavation of material, governed by the mechanics of shock wave propagation and the resulting excavation flow field, which tends to erase the initial directionality of the impactor's trajectory except in extremely low-angle impacts. Oblique impacts (those less than about 10–15 degrees from the horizontal) can produce asymmetric features such as elongated craters, uprange-ejecta blankets, and butterfly ejecta patterns, but these are relatively rare compared to the more common near-vertical or moderately oblique impacts. The rarity of highly skewed or elliptical craters in planetary imagery is due to both the statistical distribution of impact angles (which favors higher angles) and the physical processes that rapidly symmetrize the crater morphology during the excavation and modification stages. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of observed craters exhibit circular, radially symmetric depressions, with only subtle asymmetries in ejecta distribution betraying the original impact angle in most cases.","The predominance of radially symmetric, circular impact craters on planetary surfaces, despite the statistical likelihood of oblique impact trajectories due to the non-radial, hypervelocity approach vectors of most asteroidal and cometary projectiles, is primarily a consequence of the physics governing hypervelocity impacts, where the kinetic energy of the impactor is rapidly transferred to the target substrate, generating a hemispherical shock wave that propagates isotropically from the point of contact. At velocities exceeding approximately 12 km/s, the impactor's momentum is effectively coupled to the target material almost instantaneously, vaporizing both the projectile and a portion of the target, and excavating a transient cavity whose morphology is dictated by the expansion of this shock wave rather than the incident angle, except at extremely low angles (typically less than 10–15° from the horizontal) where elliptical or butterfly-shaped craters may form. The excavation flow field, governed by the Maxwell Z-model and subsequent modification stages, results in the collapse of the transient cavity into a more stable, circular form, further enhanced by gravitational slumping and rim uplift, processes that tend to erase initial asymmetries except in the most oblique cases. Ejecta distribution may exhibit asymmetry at lower angles, with downrange rays or forbidden zones, but the final crater depression remains predominantly circular due to the dominance of shock-induced excavation over mechanical displacement. The rarity of visibly skewed or elliptical craters in planetary imagery is thus a direct manifestation of the threshold impact angle required to produce significant morphological asymmetry, coupled with the overwhelming frequency of impacts occurring at angles above this threshold, and the subsequent modification processes that further circularize the crater. This phenomenon is well-documented in planetary geology, impact mechanics, and experimental hypervelocity impact studies, underscoring the fundamental role of shock wave propagation and energy partitioning in governing crater morphology."

So, it didn't quite make it to the equator, but it came very close. There is
no physical reason why you can't get aurora at the equator, but it takes a lot
of very energetic particles being ejected by the sun over a brief period.

However, as I mentioned in my comment, a solar storm of that magnitude would
wipe out most of the Earth's electric grids. Even the telegraph systems of the

Typically, auroras are confined to high-latitude regions near the geomagnetic poles due to the funneling effect of the Earth's magnetic field lines, which direct energetic particles toward the polar ionosphere, creating the auroral ovals. However, during periods of intense geomagnetic storms—often triggered by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or high-speed solar wind streams from the Sun—these auroral ovals can expand significantly toward lower latitudes, occasionally making auroras visible in mid-latitude and even near-equatorial regions, as documented during extreme events such as the 1859 Carrington Event and the 1909 auroral storm observed in Japan and other countries. The likelihood of auroral visibility at equatorial latitudes is exceedingly rare and requires exceptionally strong geomagnetic disturbances (Kp index of 9 or higher), which can temporarily alter the configuration of the magnetosphere and allow energetic particles to precipitate at much lower latitudes than usual. Consequently, while auroras are predominantly polar phenomena, historical records and space weather research confirm that under extraordinary solar and geomagnetic conditions, auroral displays can be observed far from the poles, including regions much closer to the equator.","Auroras, or polar lights, are luminous atmospheric phenomena resulting from the interaction of charged solar wind particles with the Earth's magnetosphere and upper atmosphere, typically manifesting as aurora borealis near the geomagnetic north pole and aurora australis near the geomagnetic south pole, due to the concentration of geomagnetic field lines at high latitudes which funnel energetic particles toward the polar regions. However, during periods of intense geomagnetic storms, often triggered by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or high-speed solar wind streams from the Sun, the auroral oval—the region encircling the geomagnetic poles where auroral activity is most frequent—can expand equatorward, allowing auroral displays to be observed at much lower geomagnetic latitudes, sometimes reaching mid-latitude or even subtropical regions. Historical records, such as the 1909 geomagnetic storm, document auroral sightings in locations as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and even the Caribbean, indicating that under extreme space weather conditions, the precipitation of energetic electrons and protons into the ionosphere can occur well outside the typical auroral zones. The visibility of auroras at equatorial latitudes is exceedingly rare and requires exceptionally strong geomagnetic disturbances, quantified by indices such as the Kp index reaching values of 9 or higher, which correspond to severe global geomagnetic storms capable of temporarily altering the configuration of the magnetosphere and expanding the auroral oval to encompass much lower latitudes. While the Earth's magnetic field geometry and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) generally restrict auroral phenomena to higher latitudes, the theoretical possibility of auroras at or near the geomagnetic equator exists during extreme solar events, though such occurrences are extraordinarily infrequent and are of significant interest in the study of space weather, magnetospheric physics, and historical geophysical records."

While other geothermal areas exist globally—such as Iceland’s rift zones, New Zealand’s Taupō Volcanic Zone, and Russia’s Valley of Geysers—none match Yellowstone’s combination of areal extent, diversity, and density of thermal features, making it a singular geothermal province. The park’s hydrothermal system is further characterized by complex interactions among magmatic heat, groundwater, and tectonic structures, producing a dynamic and evolving landscape that is closely monitored for volcanic and seismic hazards. Yellowstone’s uniqueness is thus a function of its underlying hotspot volcanism, extensive caldera system, and the resultant high heat flow, which collectively generate unparalleled surface geothermal phenomena.","Yellowstone National Park represents the world’s largest concentration of hydrothermal features, encompassing over 10,000 geothermal manifestations—including more than 500 active geysers—due to its location atop the Yellowstone Caldera, a supervolcano underlain by a voluminous, shallow silicic magma chamber that acts as a persistent heat source. The region’s anomalously high geothermal gradient results from the upwelling of the Yellowstone mantle plume, which thins the continental crust to less than half the global average, facilitating the transfer of magmatic heat to overlying hydrothermal systems and driving intense convective circulation of meteoric groundwater. This unique tectonomagmatic setting produces unparalleled surface expressions such as geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mudpots, with the park’s total geothermal heat flux estimated at approximately 4–8 GW, vastly exceeding that of any other terrestrial geothermal field of comparable area. While other geothermal provinces—such as Iceland’s rift-related systems, New Zealand’s Taupo Volcanic Zone, and Russia’s Valley of Geysers—exhibit significant hydrothermal activity, none match Yellowstone’s combination of feature density, diversity, and sustained magmatic heat input within a confined caldera setting. Thus, Yellowstone’s uniqueness arises from the intersection of a mantle hotspot, a large silicic magma reservoir, thin lithosphere, and extensive groundwater recharge, making it the most thermally active continental area on Earth in terms of both feature abundance and total geothermal energy output."
"In an area of frequent thunderstorms, I notice a 'crack or whoosh' sound if a strike is nearby but little or no thunder.

It approaches the sub-sonic.

Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the
length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the
observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic
characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and
possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by acoustic echoing from
terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning
strike.

In addition, thunder will sound louder when the air near the ground is colder
and the air higher in the atmosphere is warmer. This is because the acoustic
shock waves get ""trapped"" in the cold air. Such a temperature difference,
called an inversion, tends to happen at night, which is why thunder often
sounds louder at night.

See [ Wikipedia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning#Thunder) and [
wisegeek.org ](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-causes-thunder.htm)","The acoustic characteristics of thunder are governed by the propagation of shock waves generated by the rapid thermal expansion of air along the lightning channel, with the perceived sound profile—ranging from sharp cracks or whooshes to prolonged rumbles—being a function of both the observer’s distance from the strike and the energy released. Close lightning strikes produce a sharp, high-frequency crack or snap due to the direct arrival of the shock wave and minimal atmospheric attenuation, while distant strikes yield a low-frequency, rolling rumble as higher frequencies are preferentially absorbed and scattered by the atmosphere, and the sound waves are temporally smeared by varying path lengths from different segments of the lightning channel. The duration and frequency evolution of thunder, including the transition from high to low frequencies and the emergence of subsonic components, are influenced by geometric dispersion, atmospheric refraction, and the spatial extent and orientation of the lightning channel relative to the observer. The energy of the lightning strike determines the initial amplitude and spectral content of the thunder, with more energetic discharges producing louder and broader-spectrum acoustic signatures, but the perceived loudness and frequency content at a given location are predominantly modulated by distance-dependent attenuation and environmental factors such as temperature gradients, humidity, and topography. Thus, while both distance and strike energy influence the characteristics of thunder, distance primarily governs the temporal and spectral evolution of the sound, whereas energy sets the initial conditions for acoustic intensity and frequency range, with their interplay resulting in the observed auditory phenomena during thunderstorms.","The auditory perception of thunder following a lightning strike is governed by the propagation of acoustic waves through the atmosphere, modulated by distance, atmospheric stratification, and the energy released during the dielectric breakdown of air. Proximal lightning strikes generate an immediate, sharp ""crack"" or ""whoosh"" due to the rapid thermal expansion of air along the narrow plasma channel, producing high-frequency acoustic components that attenuate rapidly with distance due to atmospheric absorption and scattering, often resulting in diminished or absent thunder for nearby events. In contrast, distant lightning strikes yield a protracted, low-frequency rumble because the initial high-frequency sound waves are preferentially absorbed over greater distances, while lower-frequency components, with longer wavelengths and lower attenuation coefficients, propagate more efficiently, sometimes approaching infrasonic frequencies capable of inducing structural resonance and perceptible wall vibrations. The temporal evolution of thunder, from an initial high-frequency onset to a deep, rolling rumble, reflects the spatially extended nature of the lightning channel, the velocity of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at sea level), and the dispersion of acoustic energy over varying atmospheric paths, with the duration of audible thunder correlating to the length and orientation of the lightning channel relative to the observer. The perceived intensity and duration of thunder are thus not solely functions of the intrinsic energy of the lightning discharge, but are also critically dependent on the observer's distance from the strike, atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, wind profiles), and topographic influences on acoustic wave propagation and reflection."

Schmidt-Appleman criterion (SAC) is used to model contrail formation. I advise

the relevant formulae and literature references.

While it is possible to transcribe the formulae here, the reference cited does
a better job of presenting state of the art (2012).","Contrail formation is governed by the interplay of atmospheric thermodynamics and aircraft exhaust properties, primarily determined by the Schmidt–Appleman criterion, which states that contrails form when the ambient air is sufficiently cold and moist such that the water vapor emitted by aircraft engines, after mixing and cooling, reaches saturation and condenses into ice crystals. The critical temperature for contrail formation, T_crit, can be estimated using the equation T_crit = T_e - (L_v/c_p) * ln[(E * q_v + q_e)/(q_v)], where T_e is exhaust temperature, L_v is latent heat of vaporization, c_p is specific heat at constant pressure, E is engine efficiency, q_v is ambient specific humidity, and q_e is exhaust water vapor mixing ratio. Contrail probability increases when ambient temperature at flight altitude is below T_crit and relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) exceeds approximately 70–80%, with pressure and humidity profiles further modulating the supersaturation threshold necessary for persistent contrail formation. Aircraft parameters such as altitude, speed, and engine efficiency affect exhaust plume mixing and water vapor emission, while meteorological data (temperature, pressure, humidity) at the aircraft’s location and time are essential for calculating the saturation vapor pressure and RHi, both of which are critical for contrail prediction. For data visualization, integrating these variables into a probabilistic model—potentially leveraging logistic regression or machine learning trained on historical contrail observations—can yield a spatially and temporally resolved estimate of contrail formation likelihood along flight paths, with the Schmidt–Appleman threshold serving as the physical basis for the model.","The probability of contrail formation along an airline flight path is fundamentally governed by the thermodynamic and microphysical conditions of the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere, specifically the ambient temperature, pressure, and relative humidity with respect to ice, in conjunction with aircraft-specific parameters such as altitude, speed, and engine efficiency, which together determine the water vapor emission index and exhaust plume mixing characteristics. The Schmidt-Appleman criterion provides the foundational framework, stipulating that contrails form when the ambient temperature at flight altitude is below the threshold temperature \( T_{sat} \), calculated by equating the saturation vapor pressure over ice to the partial pressure of water vapor in the exhaust plume, factoring in the aircraft’s propulsion efficiency and fuel hydrogen content. This threshold is typically expressed as \( T_{sat} = T_{amb} - \Delta T \), where \( \Delta T \) is a function of engine efficiency, fuel composition, and atmospheric pressure, and contrail formation is probable when the ambient temperature is less than \( T_{sat} \) and the relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) exceeds approximately 100%. For probabilistic estimation, meteorological uncertainty and subgrid-scale variability can be incorporated using ensemble weather data or statistical models, yielding a contrail formation probability as a function of the joint probability distribution of temperature and RHi exceeding the critical thresholds at the aircraft’s instantaneous position and altitude. Advanced modeling may further integrate the persistence criterion, requiring RHi to exceed the ice supersaturation threshold for persistent contrails, and can be visualized spatially and temporally by overlaying flight trajectories on gridded fields of contrail formation probability derived from real-time or reanalysis meteorological datasets, thereby enabling high-resolution, data-driven contrail climatology and impact assessment."
"The Wikipedia article on the subject of the ""Antarctic ice sheet"" says that:

The icing of Antarctica began in the middle Eocene about 45.5 million years ago and escalated during the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago.

The article later says that:

Ice enters the sheet through precipitation as snow. This snow is then compacted to form glacier ice which moves under gravity towards the coast.

However it looks like, from the photos of Antarctica, that this transfer of ice to the coasts is not happening everywhere on Antarctica. Rather, many places seem to be under a perpetual ancient ice cover.

If the precipitation was recycled at a continuous rate everywhere, it shouldn't be possible to obtain a 1.5 million year old core sample (according to an article in Nature) or structures such as Vostok Station that covers an ancient lake.

A similar location is Dome F that according to Wikipedia has a yearly precipitation of about 25 mm (millimeters; approx. 0.98 inches).

So the question is, if we have a 25 mm precipitation per year for even just 10 million years, we should have an ice cover that's 250 kilometers thick. Or if we had it during just a 5 million year time span, it should give us an ice cover that's 125 kilometers thick.

Reasonably we could allow for some compression of the ice but still keeping in mind that we are not talking about a neutron star here.

Ice floats with gravity towards lower elevation, the flow continues until the
base of the ice sheet becomes floating and the ice forms an ice shelf or
icebergs.

Due to the subglacial topography, basal melting and mass balance, the flow
velocities vary over a large range, faster outflows are glaciers. The pattern
is somehow similar to how rivers transport rainwater towards the coasts.

The thickness of the ice sheet is controlled by a complex relation between [
accumulation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_zone) , [ ablation
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_zone) and compaction.

The ice velocity map shows, that some areas are unaffected by the flow towards
the coast. Some of these areas are ice-free. Also at some inland locations, as
Vostok, the velocity is very slow. Also, note that this is the surface
velocity. At the base, the ice flows slower or not at all.

To investigate the mass balance further, I recommended you to download [
Quantarctica ](http://quantarctica.npolar.no/) and look closer at the
datasets. [ Shepherd et al (2012)
](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140006608.pdf) is a
good first read about the methods used to estimate changes in ice mass and the
present changes.","The apparent discrepancy between low annual precipitation rates (e.g., 25 mm/year at Dome F) and the current Antarctic ice sheet thickness (typically 2–4 km) arises from the dynamic equilibrium between mass accumulation (primarily from snowfall) and mass loss (mainly via basal melting, sublimation, and especially ice flow toward the coast and subsequent calving or melting at the ice shelves and ocean margins). Over geological timescales, the ice sheet is not a static archive of all accumulated snowfall; rather, it is a dynamic system where gravitational flow causes ice to deform and move outward from the high interior domes toward the lower-elevation periphery, continuously exporting mass and preventing indefinite thickening. The age of the deepest ice cores (up to ~1.5 million years) reflects the balance between slow accumulation, compaction, and the rate at which older ice is advected downward and laterally, eventually being lost at the margins, rather than a simple sum of annual precipitation over millions of years. The vertical compaction of snow into firn and then glacial ice, combined with the plastic flow of ice under its own weight, means that the effective thickness of the ice sheet is limited by the balance of input and output, the geothermal heat flux at the base, and the mechanical properties of ice, not merely by cumulative precipitation. Thus, the Antarctic ice sheet’s thickness is governed by the interplay of accumulation, ice dynamics, basal processes, and marginal ablation, resulting in a steady-state or quasi-steady-state system where ancient ice persists only in regions of low flow and low ablation, and the total thickness is constrained by these dynamic processes rather than by simple arithmetic accumulation.","The apparent discrepancy between the modest thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet (typically 2–4 kilometers) and the theoretical accumulation from persistent low precipitation rates over multimillion-year timescales arises from the dynamic equilibrium between mass input (primarily snowfall) and mass loss mechanisms, including basal melting, sublimation, wind ablation, and especially ice flow via internal deformation and gravitationally-driven ice streaming toward the margins and outlet glaciers. The ice sheet is not a static repository but a dynamic system governed by the principles of glaciology, where the residence time of ice is finite and determined by the balance of accumulation and ablation, with the oldest ice preserved only in regions of minimal flow and low accumulation, such as domes and divides (e.g., Dome Fuji, Dome C, Vostok), where horizontal ice velocities approach zero and vertical thinning dominates. The compaction of firn to glacial ice, plastic deformation under overburden pressure, and basal sliding over subglacial hydrological systems facilitate the continual transfer of ice mass from the interior to the periphery, precluding indefinite vertical growth and instead maintaining a steady-state or quasi-steady-state ice thickness modulated by climatic, geothermal, and topographic controls. The preservation of ancient ice, as evidenced by deep ice cores, is thus a function of low accumulation rates and minimal ice flow, while most of the ice sheet undergoes continuous renewal and export of mass to the ocean via calving and basal melting, processes that are further modulated by feedbacks involving isostatic adjustment, ice–albedo interactions, and atmospheric circulation patterns. Consequently, the Antarctic ice sheet’s thickness reflects a long-term balance between input and output fluxes, not a simple cumulative sum of precipitation, with the system’s mass and geometry constrained by the interplay of glaciological processes, paleoclimatic variability, and the mechanical properties of ice under stress."

Remember it is just an imaginary line on the Earth's surface used for
georeferencing purposes, so movement of the reference line has no implications
so long as we can still reference to it (hence the International Reference
Meridian).

In fact, the position of the Greenwich meridian has changed throughout
history, mainly due to the Airy Transit Observatory (the original location of
the Greenwich meridian) being built next door to the previous one (to maintain
the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect.
Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much
larger than the change in position. The adoption of WGS84 (""World Geodetic
System 84"") as the positioning system has moved the geodetic prime meridian
102.478 metres east of its last astronomic position (measured at Greenwich).
The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all
by any kind of sign or marking (as the older astronomic position was) in
Greenwich, but can be located using a GPS receiver. Due to the movement of
Earth's tectonic plates, the line of 0° longitude along the surface of the
Earth has slowly moved toward the west from this shifted position by a few
centimetres; that is, towards the Airy Transit Observatory (or the Airy
Transit Observatory has moved toward the east, depending on your point of
view) since 1984 (or the 1960s). With the introduction of satellite
technology, it became possible to create a more accurate and detailed global
map. With these advances there also arose the necessity to define a reference
meridian that, whilst being derived from the Airy Transit Circle, would also
take into account the effects of plate movement and variations in the way that
the Earth was spinning - the International Reference Meridian.

Why are tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal more frequent and stronger than those in the Arabian Sea?,"a low level jet covers the Arabian Sea during the indian sunner moonson, which cause tropical cycolones at the north india.",50,['N/A'],['india_cyclone/nature10552_ref1.txt'],['india_cyclone/nature10552_ref12.txt'],"$\begingroup$

During the Indian Summer Monsoon, a low level jet covers the Arabian Sea. This
causes vertical wind shear to increase over the Arabian Sea and inhibits
cyclogenesis in the region. Hence, less tropical cyclone activity compared to

(First line)","Tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are more frequent and intense than those in the Arabian Sea due to a combination of oceanographic, atmospheric, and geographical factors, including higher sea surface temperatures, greater oceanic heat content, and increased moisture availability from extensive riverine inflow, which enhance cyclogenesis and intensification. The Bay of Bengal's semi-enclosed geography reduces wind shear and allows for longer cyclone residence times, while the surrounding landmasses funnel monsoonal winds and low-pressure systems, further promoting vorticity and convective activity. In contrast, the Arabian Sea experiences stronger vertical wind shear, cooler sea surface temperatures due to upwelling, and the intrusion of dry continental air from the Arabian Peninsula, all of which inhibit cyclone formation and intensification. Additionally, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) more frequently favor convective disturbances over the Bay of Bengal, leading to a higher frequency of low-pressure systems developing into cyclonic storms. Historical climatological data corroborate that over 80% of North Indian Ocean cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal, with a higher proportion reaching severe cyclonic storm status compared to the Arabian Sea, underscoring the region's heightened vulnerability to tropical cyclone hazards.","The greater frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal compared to the Arabian Sea are attributable to a confluence of oceanographic, atmospheric, and geomorphological factors, including higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs), enhanced oceanic heat content, and increased moisture availability due to substantial riverine input from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, which collectively augment latent heat flux and cyclogenesis potential. The Bay of Bengal’s semi-enclosed geography facilitates the retention of warm waters and reduces upwelling, maintaining SSTs above the critical threshold (approximately 26.5°C) necessary for sustained deep convection and the intensification of low-pressure systems into severe cyclonic storms. In contrast, the Arabian Sea is subject to more frequent intrusions of dry, subsiding air masses from the Arabian Peninsula, higher vertical wind shear, and episodic upwelling induced by the southwest monsoon, all of which inhibit the vertical development and intensification of cyclonic vortices. Additionally, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and equatorial waves more frequently enhance convective activity over the Bay of Bengal during the pre- and post-monsoon periods, further increasing the probability of cyclogenesis and rapid intensification events. Orographic influences from the Eastern Ghats and the Himalayas also modulate regional atmospheric circulation, steering cyclonic systems toward the Bay of Bengal and amplifying their landfall impacts on densely populated littoral zones."

Zealandia, also known as Te Riu-a-Māui, is a submerged continental fragment that meets most geological criteria for a continent, such as having a crustal thickness of 10–30 km (compared to 7 km for oceanic crust), a coherent and contiguous area of approximately 4.9 million square kilometers, and a unique geological history distinct from Australia and Antarctica. However, Zealandia is significantly smaller than the traditionally recognized continents, being only about half the size of Australia, and over 90% of its landmass is submerged, which complicates its classification under conventional definitions that emphasize emergent land area. Some geologists argue that the absence of a strict size criterion and the fulfillment of other continental characteristics justify Zealandia's recognition as Earth's eighth continent, while others contend that its relatively small size and extensive submergence make it more accurately described as a continental fragment or microcontinent. The debate over Zealandia's status highlights the lack of a universally accepted definition for continents, with current discourse focusing on whether geological distinctiveness or emergent landmass should be prioritized in continental classification.","The classification of a landmass as a continent in Earth science is not governed by a universally codified set of criteria, but rather by a combination of geological, geophysical, and morphological parameters, including substantial elevation above the surrounding oceanic crust, the presence of continental crust with a thickness typically ranging from 20 to 50 kilometers (as opposed to the 7–10 kilometers of oceanic crust), a coherent and geologically distinct area, and a unique assemblage of rock types such as granites, metamorphic rocks, and sedimentary sequences indicative of continental lithosphere. Zealandia, also known as Te Riu-a-Māui, is a submerged continental fragment encompassing approximately 4.9 million square kilometers, which is markedly smaller than the traditionally recognized continents but still significantly larger than microcontinents or large islands, and it exhibits all the fundamental geological hallmarks of a continent, including a thickened crust, tectonic independence, and a well-defined area demarcated by the oceanic crust of the southwest Pacific. The issue of minimum size for continental status remains contentious; while there is no strict lower limit, most definitions implicitly reference Australia, at about 7.7 million square kilometers, as the smallest ""full"" continent, yet Zealandia's area, though smaller, is still an order of magnitude greater than typical microcontinents such as Madagascar or the Seychelles. Some geologists argue that Zealandia should be classified as a continent based on its crustal properties, tectonic history, and geological coherence, while others contend that its relatively small size and extensive submergence (with only about 6% above sea level, primarily New Zealand and New Caledonia) render it more accurately described as a continental fragment or submerged continent. Ultimately, the debate over Zealandia's status underscores the lack of a universally accepted, size-based threshold for continental classification in geology, highlighting the interplay between geophysical evidence, historical precedent, and evolving scientific paradigms in defining what constitutes a continent."

more/10-deepest-parts-of-the-ocean/)","The extraordinary depth of the Mariana Trench, reaching a maximum of 11,033 meters at Challenger Deep, is primarily attributed to its tectonic setting as a subduction zone where the Pacific Plate, one of the oldest, coldest, and densest oceanic plates, is being subducted beneath the smaller, less dense Mariana Plate. The age and thermal contraction of the Pacific Plate increase its density, causing it to sink more steeply and deeply into the mantle, resulting in a pronounced negative isostatic anomaly and a deeper trench profile compared to younger, warmer subducting plates found at other trenches. The convergence rate between the plates, the sediment supply, and the lack of significant accretionary prism development further contribute to the trench’s exceptional depth by minimizing infilling and allowing the subducting slab to descend at a steeper angle. Additionally, the absence of significant nearby continental crust reduces buoyant support, enhancing the downward flexure of the subducting plate and deepening the trench. The interplay of these factors—plate age, density, subduction angle, sedimentation, and tectonic configuration—distinguishes the Mariana Trench as the deepest oceanic trench on Earth.","The extraordinary depth of the Mariana Trench, reaching a maximum of approximately 11,033 meters at the Challenger Deep, is primarily attributed to its tectonic setting as an intra-oceanic subduction zone where the Pacific Plate, characterized by its old, cold, and dense lithosphere, is subducting beneath the relatively younger and less dense Mariana Plate. The significant negative isostatic anomaly results from the subducting slab’s high density and thermal contraction, which causes the trench to attain greater bathymetric depression compared to other subduction zones where the subducting lithosphere is younger, warmer, and more buoyant, thus producing shallower trenches. Additionally, the absence of significant sediment infill, due to the trench’s remote pelagic location and minimal terrigenous sediment supply, preserves the extreme depth by preventing aggradation of the trench floor. The geometry of the subduction interface, including the steepness of the subducting slab and the narrowness of the overriding plate, further accentuates the trench’s depth by promoting a sharp flexural bend and minimal accretionary prism development. Collectively, these factors—old plate age, high slab density, thermal structure, sediment starvation, and unique plate boundary geometry—synergistically generate the Mariana Trench’s status as the deepest known oceanic trench on Earth."
"Bohrmann et al. 1989 advanced the idea that the silicate phase from some clinoptilolites come from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal (from radiolarians in that case but presumably also other siliceous microfossils).

(1989) proposed that the silicate framework of some authigenic clinoptilolite in marine sediments originates from the diagenetic transformation of biogenic opal, specifically radiolarian-derived amorphous silica, implicating the dissolution-reprecipitation pathway under low-temperature, alkaline conditions during early diagenesis. This hypothesis remains widely accepted, with subsequent studies corroborating the link between biogenic opal dissolution and zeolite genesis, particularly for clinoptilolite and, in some cases, heulandite, although clinoptilolite is most frequently cited due to its prevalence in marine and lacustrine settings rich in siliceous microfossils. Other authigenic zeolites, such as mordenite and phillipsite, have also been reported to form from biogenic silica sources, but the geochemical and mineralogical conditions favoring their crystallization differ, often involving variations in cation availability (notably K+, Na+, and Ca2+), pH, and sedimentary facies. Since 1989, advances in analytical techniques (e.g., stable isotope geochemistry, high-resolution electron microscopy, and synchrotron-based spectroscopy) have enabled more precise tracing of silica sources and transformation pathways, confirming the role of biogenic opal in zeolite formation and expanding the understanding of the complex interplay between organic matter degradation, porewater chemistry, and zeolite mineralogy. The current consensus recognizes clinoptilolite as the principal zeolite directly linked to biogenic opal diagenesis, but acknowledges that under specific geochemical regimes, other zeolites may also derive from biogenic silica, with ongoing research refining the mechanistic and environmental controls governing these authigenic processes.","Bohrmann et al.

This hypothesis remains influential, with subsequent research confirming clinoptilolite’s frequent association with opaline silica dissolution fronts and the release of reactive SiO₂, Al, and alkali cations, yet the exclusive linkage of biogenic opal-derived silica to clinoptilolite formation is not universally accepted, as other zeolite species such as heulandite, mordenite, and phillipsite have also been documented in sedimentary environments where biogenic silica dissolution is significant. Post-1989 studies, including isotopic, petrographic, and geochemical investigations, have expanded the understanding of zeolite authigenesis, demonstrating that the transformation of biogenic opal can contribute to the nucleation and growth of multiple zeolite phases, with mineralogical outcomes governed by factors such as porewater chemistry, sedimentation rate, temperature, and the availability of exchangeable cations (notably Na⁺, K⁺, and Ca²⁺). The diagenetic sequence often involves the initial dissolution of opal-A to opal-CT and subsequent conversion to microcrystalline quartz, with zeolitization occurring preferentially in alkaline, saline, or volcaniclastic-rich settings where the chemical milieu favors zeolite stability fields. While clinoptilolite remains the most commonly cited zeolite linked to biogenic opal degradation, the literature documents occurrences of other zeolites, particularly in tuffaceous or volcanogenic sedimentary contexts, suggesting that the authigenic zeolite assemblage derived from biogenic opal is not monotypic but context-dependent. Overall, the evolving consensus is that biogenic opal dissolution is a significant, but not exclusive, precursor to authigenic zeolite formation in marine and lacustrine sediments, with ongoing research refining the paragenetic relationships and geochemical controls governing zeolite mineralogy in diagenetic environments."

The Antarctic Peninsula, one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth, experiences episodic warm air advection and downslope winds (foehn effect), which rapidly elevate surface temperatures by compressional heating as air descends the leeward slopes of the Transantarctic Mountains. This anomalous warmth is exacerbated by reduced sea ice extent, which diminishes the albedo effect and enhances heat absorption, further destabilizing local climate systems. The event underscores the vulnerability of polar regions to global warming, with implications for accelerated glacial melt, sea level rise, and ecosystem disruption. Such temperature extremes are monitored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and serve as critical indicators of the intensifying impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and shifting atmospheric circulation patterns on polar climatology.","The record high temperature exceeding 18 °C in Antarctica, specifically reported at the Esperanza research station on the Antarctic Peninsula, is attributable to a confluence of synoptic-scale meteorological phenomena, including the advection of warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes, the presence of a strong föhn wind effect resulting from orographic lifting and subsequent adiabatic warming on the leeward side of the peninsula, and anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns such as a positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and weakened circumpolar westerlies. These conditions are further exacerbated by the ongoing anthropogenic climate change, which has led to a pronounced regional warming trend in the Antarctic Peninsula, evidenced by increased mean annual temperatures, accelerated glacial retreat, and diminished sea ice extent. The timing of the record, despite it being austral summer rather than winter as sometimes misreported, underscores the seasonality of extreme temperature events in polar regions, where insolation, albedo feedbacks from melting snow and ice, and transient weather systems can produce episodic thermal anomalies. The event is contextualized within the broader climatological framework of polar amplification, wherein high-latitude regions exhibit greater sensitivity to global temperature increases due to feedback mechanisms such as reduced surface reflectivity and increased atmospheric water vapor. Such unprecedented temperature extremes in Antarctica serve as critical indicators of systemic shifts in the cryosphere and global climate system, with implications for ice sheet stability, sea level rise, and the integrity of polar ecosystems."

At sunrise and sunset the angle the Sun's light makes with the Earth at those
locations is low compared with angle the light makes at midday. Because of the
low angle, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere before it
reaches the Earth's surface and the eyes of anyone watching either the Sun
rise or the Sun set.

colours are all different. Red has the longest wavelength at 650 nm. Each of
the other colours have shorter wavelengths with violet having the shortest at
400 nm.

As the Sun's light passes through the atmosphere it get scattered by the air
molecules and particles in the air such as dust and aerosols.

Due to a phenomenon known as [ Rayleigh scattering

of light (greens, blues, violets) are scattered first, leaving the shorter

As the Sun approaches the horizon, its light traverses a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere, increasing the path length and thus the amount of scattering, which removes much of the blue and green light from the direct solar beam and allows the longer-wavelength reds and oranges to dominate the sky's appearance. The presence of aerosols, dust, and water vapor can further enhance these warm colors through Mie scattering, which affects all wavelengths more equally but can intensify the scattering of red and orange light under certain atmospheric conditions. The sky does not simply turn a darker blue because the increased atmospheric path length at low solar angles scatters away the blue light before it reaches the observer, and the remaining transmitted sunlight is depleted in blue wavelengths, shifting the observed color spectrum toward the red end. Additional factors such as atmospheric pollution, volcanic ash, and humidity can modulate the intensity and palette of sunrise and sunset colors by altering the scattering and absorption characteristics of the atmosphere.","The vivid red, pink, and orange hues observed during sunrises and sunsets are primarily the result of Rayleigh scattering, a process wherein shorter-wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered more efficiently by atmospheric molecules and aerosols than longer-wavelength red and orange photons. As the solar elevation angle decreases near the horizon, the optical path length through the troposphere increases substantially, causing the majority of blue and green wavelengths to be scattered out of the direct line of sight, while the remaining transmitted sunlight is enriched in longer wavelengths, manifesting as warm colors. The presence of atmospheric particulates such as dust, smoke, and water droplets can further enhance this effect through Mie scattering, which preferentially scatters longer wavelengths and can intensify the saturation of reds and oranges. The sky does not simply become a darker blue during these periods because the direct solar beam is depleted of shorter wavelengths, and the scattered blue light is redirected away from the observer’s vantage point, leaving the observer to perceive the predominance of the less-scattered red and orange wavelengths. This phenomenon is modulated by atmospheric composition, humidity, and the presence of pollutants, which can alter the scattering regime and thus the chromatic characteristics of twilight and crepuscular skies."

I'm not entirely sure how the calculations in the linked article are
performed, but I recall calculating this as a student and ending up somewhere
around 5 km, so it sounds right. Simple calculations often assume an

](http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mod-x/id-pres.html)","To determine the altitude above sea level at which an air shield would contain exactly half of Earth's atmospheric mass, one must integrate the barometric formula, which describes how atmospheric pressure (and thus mass) decreases exponentially with altitude due to the hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law, while also accounting for the increasing surface area of spherical shells as radius increases. The total atmospheric mass is concentrated near the surface, with approximately 50% residing below about 5.6 km, corresponding to one scale height (H ≈ 8.5 km for Earth’s atmosphere at standard temperature and pressure), but the precise altitude for half-mass containment is slightly higher due to the geometric factor of expanding spherical shells. The relevant calculation involves integrating the atmospheric density profile ρ(h) = ρ₀ exp(-h/H) over the volume between the Earth's surface (radius Rₑ) and the shield (radius Rₑ + h), and solving for h such that the enclosed mass equals half the total atmospheric mass, taking into account the Earth's radius (Rₑ ≈ 6371 km) and the exponential decay of pressure with altitude. This yields an altitude of approximately 5.6 km above sea level, where the overlying atmospheric mass is half the total, but the exact value may vary slightly depending on temperature, humidity, and local atmospheric conditions, as well as the assumption of an isothermal atmosphere. In summary, constructing an air shield at roughly 5.6 km altitude would enclose half the atmospheric mass, with this result derived from integrating the barometric formula over a spherical shell and considering both atmospheric pressure decay and the geometric increase in shell volume with altitude.","To determine the altitude at which an impermeable air shield must be constructed to enclose exactly half of Earth's atmospheric mass, one must integrate the barometric formula, which describes the exponential decrease of atmospheric pressure—and thus mass density—with altitude, while simultaneously accounting for the geometric increase in the volume of spherical shells as a function of radius above mean sea level. The total atmospheric mass is predominantly concentrated in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, with approximately 50% of the mass residing below an altitude known as the atmospheric median mass height. Employing the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and assuming an isothermal atmosphere for simplification, the pressure (and thus cumulative mass) at a given altitude z can be expressed as P(z) = P₀ exp(-z/H), where H is the scale height (~8.5 km for Earth), and the cumulative mass fraction below altitude z is given by 1 - exp(-z/H). Solving for the altitude at which this cumulative mass fraction equals 0.5 yields z = H ln(2), which evaluates to approximately 5.9 km above sea level, indicating that an air shield at this altitude would contain half the atmospheric mass. This result is robust to first order, though more precise calculations would require integrating the actual temperature and pressure profiles from the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, accounting for non-isothermal stratification and variable gravitational acceleration with altitude."

The precise computation of these nodes is non-trivial and typically requires numerical root-finding algorithms or specialized libraries; authoritative references include the ECMWF documentation, WMO GRIB2 specification, and texts on numerical methods for spectral models, such as ""Spectral Methods in Atmospheric Modeling"" by Robert Sadourny. Publicly available implementations for generating Gaussian grid latitudes exist in scientific software libraries such as ECMWF’s ecCodes, the Climate Data Operators (CDO), and Python packages like pyproj or cfgrib, which encapsulate the Legendre polynomial root-finding and latitude transformation. For direct algorithmic implementation, the Golub-Welsch algorithm is commonly employed to compute the Legendre polynomial roots and weights, which are then mapped to latitude, and this approach is foundational in the construction of Gaussian grids for global spectral models in geophysical fluid dynamics."

A CDL file is basically a text output from a netcdf file. If you want to know

programs built to read/write netcdf, you can use the simple text output of
""ncdump"" and then read/write it with a basic text editor. You can also use
""ncgen"" to regenerate a netcdf file based on the new CDL file. I've used this

I know volcanologists study volcanoes. Is there a subdiscipline that only studies maga or lava?

Perhaps they are called [ Igneous Petrologists
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_petrology) ?

Someone who studies magma/lava flows tends to go by Geophysicist because they
inherently study continuum mechanics and fluid flow.","Volcanology is the scientific study of volcanoes, volcanic phenomena, and related processes, but within this field, the study of magma and lava specifically falls under the subdiscipline of igneous petrology, which focuses on the origin, evolution, composition, and crystallization of igneous rocks formed from molten material. While the term ""magmatologist"" is not widely recognized as a formal designation, researchers specializing in magma genesis, transport, differentiation, and emplacement are often referred to as igneous petrologists or magmatic petrologists, and their work encompasses geochemical, mineralogical, and thermodynamic analyses of magmatic systems. These specialists investigate magma chamber processes, partial melting, fractional crystallization, magma mixing, volatile content, and the rheological properties of both magma and lava, employing techniques such as phase equilibria experiments, isotopic studies, and geophysical imaging. The study of lava, as the extrusive manifestation of magma, involves additional subfields such as physical volcanology and lava flow dynamics, which analyze flow morphology, cooling rates, crystallization kinetics, and emplacement mechanisms. Overall, while volcanology provides the broader context, the focused study of magma and lava is primarily situated within igneous petrology and magmatic studies, with no universally adopted term like ""magmatology,"" though the concept is functionally addressed by magmatic petrologists and related specialists.","Within the broader discipline of volcanology, the specialized study of magma and lava falls under the domain of igneous petrology and, more specifically, magmatology, which focuses on the genesis, evolution, transport, emplacement, and crystallization of magma within the Earth's crust and mantle, as well as its subsequent eruption as lava. Magmatologists investigate the physicochemical properties of silicate melts, including viscosity, volatile content, phase equilibria, and the thermodynamic and kinetic processes governing partial melting, fractional crystallization, magma mixing, assimilation, and degassing. This subdiscipline employs geochemical, isotopic, and mineralogical analyses, experimental petrology, and geophysical imaging to elucidate magma chamber processes, melt migration pathways, and the petrogenesis of igneous rocks, thereby providing critical insights into tectonic settings such as mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, and intraplate hotspots. While volcanologists encompass the study of volcanic phenomena including eruption dynamics, volcanic hazards, and surface processes, magmatology is more narrowly concerned with subsurface magmatic systems and the fundamental processes controlling magma generation, evolution, and eruption. Thus, although ""magmatologist"" is not as widely recognized as ""volcanologist,"" the term accurately describes researchers who specialize in the study of magma and lava, integrating petrological, geochemical, and geophysical methodologies to advance understanding of igneous processes."
"Someone I know posted a question about climate change that I do not know how to answer. While I do believe (for lack of better word) in climate change, I do not know how to answer this persons question. The tl;dr of the question is:

The person is implying that warming/cooling reoccurs periodically on the Earth, and that the current climate change threat is overblown.

There is evidence that greenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is difficult to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the role of weathering).

The current warming is _still_ a natural phenomenon, but it's now [ primarily
driven by _our_ input, and not other 'natural' phenomena
](https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change/Evidence-for-climate-
change) .","The end of the last ice age, known as the Last Glacial Maximum (~20,000 years ago), was primarily driven by cyclical changes in Earth’s orbital parameters—Milankovitch cycles—which altered the distribution and intensity of solar insolation, initiating a feedback loop involving albedo changes and gradual increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane released from oceans and permafrost, with CO₂ concentrations rising from ~180 ppm during glacial maxima to ~280 ppm in the preindustrial Holocene. Paleoclimate data from ice cores, sediment records, and isotopic analysis demonstrate that these natural climate transitions occurred over millennia, with rates of temperature and CO₂ increase far slower than those observed since the Industrial Revolution. Contemporary anthropogenic climate change is distinguished by the unprecedented rapidity and magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions—primarily from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes—resulting in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations exceeding 420 ppm, a level not seen in at least 800,000 years, and a rate of warming (~0.2°C per decade) that is orders of magnitude faster than post-glacial transitions. Attribution studies using climate models and paleoclimate reconstructions confirm that current warming cannot be explained by natural forcings alone, as solar and volcanic activity have remained relatively stable or even trended toward cooling, while the radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases dominates the energy imbalance driving modern climate change. Thus, while Earth’s climate has naturally fluctuated due to orbital, solar, and geological factors, the current episode is unique in its speed, scale, and direct linkage to human activities, as evidenced by multiple independent lines of scientific evidence.","The termination of the last glacial period, or Last Glacial Maximum, approximately 20,000 years ago, was primarily driven by cyclical variations in Earth’s orbital parameters—eccentricity, obliquity, and precession—collectively known as Milankovitch cycles, which modulate the distribution and intensity of solar insolation at high latitudes, initiating deglaciation. This initial orbital forcing triggered positive feedback mechanisms, notably the ice-albedo feedback and the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane from oceanic and terrestrial reservoirs, amplifying global temperature rise; however, atmospheric CO₂ concentrations during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition peaked near 280 ppm, substantially lower than the current anthropogenic levels exceeding 420 ppm. Paleoclimatic proxies, including ice core isotopic records, sediment cores, and paleobotanical data, demonstrate that natural climate variability, while significant, occurred over millennial timescales and was tightly coupled to external forcings, whereas contemporary climate change is characterized by an unprecedented rate and magnitude of warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, as evidenced by radiative forcing calculations, carbon isotope signatures, and climate model attribution studies. The distinction between Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles and present-day climate change lies in the underlying drivers: natural orbital and geophysical processes versus rapid, large-scale fossil fuel combustion, land use change, and industrial emissions, which have overwhelmed natural carbon sinks and perturbed the global carbon cycle beyond Holocene variability. Thus, while Earth’s climate system has always exhibited dynamic variability, the current trajectory and pace of anthropogenic warming are anomalous in the context of the last several hundred thousand years, with profound implications for climate sensitivity, feedbacks, and biospheric stability."

Do you mean [ Ground Penetrating Radar ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-
penetrating_radar) ? This is typically limited to very shallow depths though -
eg. archaeological investigations, police forensics (finding graves), and
civil engineering site investigations. The latter can go to tens of meters and
would be used for planning foundations, excavations, etc (I know of an example
where it was used for site characterization for a planned rowing lake). The
depth limit is typically due to attenuation in brackish groundwaters. Ice
applications can typically go further due to the lack of conducting liquid
water.

Or are you thinking of [ Reflection ('Active') Seismic Surveys
](http://principles.ou.edu/seismic_explo/reflect/reflect.html) , which work on
a similar principle but using sound waves. Sound waves can travel to the far
side of the Earth (cf. large earthquake 'P' waves), but reflection surveys are
typically looking at the upper crust (few km) and rarely go beyond the base of
the crust (aka the 'Moho') which is a strong seismic reflector. Reflection
seismic surveys are widely used in the oil business.","The technique described is known as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), a geophysical method that utilizes high-frequency electromagnetic waves (typically in the range of 10 MHz to 2.6 GHz) to probe subsurface structures by transmitting radio waves into the ground and recording the reflected signals from subsurface interfaces. The differentiation of rock types using GPR is based on contrasts in dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability, which influence the velocity and attenuation of the radar waves as they propagate through various geological materials. Reflections occur at boundaries where there is a significant change in these electromagnetic properties, such as between sedimentary layers, igneous intrusions, or water-saturated versus dry zones, allowing geologists to infer lithological variations and stratigraphic boundaries. The amplitude, travel time, and frequency content of the returned signals are analyzed using radargram interpretation, signal processing algorithms, and sometimes inversion modeling to estimate the depth, geometry, and material properties of subsurface features. While GPR is highly effective for shallow investigations (typically up to tens of meters, depending on material conductivity), deeper rock characterization often employs seismic reflection methods, which use acoustic rather than electromagnetic waves and are sensitive to contrasts in acoustic impedance between rock layers.","The method referenced is known as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), a geophysical technique that utilizes high-frequency electromagnetic waves, typically in the range of tens of megahertz to several gigahertz, to image subsurface structures by transmitting radio waves into the ground and recording the reflected signals from subsurface interfaces. The differentiation of rock types using GPR is predicated on contrasts in the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of geological materials, which influence the velocity and attenuation of the radar waves as well as the amplitude and timing of reflected signals at lithological boundaries. The reflection coefficient at an interface is governed by the impedance contrast between adjacent materials, allowing geoscientists to infer stratigraphy, lithology, and the presence of features such as fractures, voids, or changes in mineralogy based on the character and geometry of the returned radargrams. While GPR is highly effective for delineating shallow subsurface features and unconsolidated sediments, its penetration depth is limited in highly conductive materials such as clays or saline groundwater, and its resolution decreases with depth due to signal attenuation and scattering. For deeper investigations and more robust lithological discrimination, seismic reflection methods, which exploit contrasts in acoustic impedance rather than electromagnetic properties, are often employed in conjunction with GPR to provide complementary subsurface information."

"I got caught in a downpour while climbing a mountain and was amazed to see, as I climbed down, the tiny trickles of water combine to form mini-streams, the dry rocks I had climbed up now hosted sizable waterfalls, and the path which I had followed to the mountain had become a small river.

But it got me wondering about my question, which is the reverse of this. Why, after a long period of dry weather, are many rivers still flowing? I live near a river and it seems that it takes over a week of dry weather before there's any noticeable drop in its level. How does it not simply run out of water? Is it simply that it takes very a long time for the water at its source and the sources of all its tributaries to reach the point I'm observing from?

It seems there's a constant supply of water when I would have expected the network of rivers to start draining, and the drying up starting from the source the moment the rain stopped.","The rivers are generally fed by water that percolated into the ground, which helps it last during the dry season.",64,['N/A'],['dry_weather_river/usgov.txt'],['dry_weather_river/usgov3.txt' 'dry_weather_river/usgov2.txt'],"$\begingroup$

The rivers are generally fed by water that percolated into the ground, it
takes longer for that water to work its way down to the stream so the streams
and rivers keep flowing long after the initial rain. [
https://water.usgs.gov/edu/rivers-contain-groundwater.html
](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/rivers-contain-groundwater.html)","River baseflow persistence during prolonged dry weather is primarily sustained by groundwater discharge, where aquifers and saturated soils gradually release stored water into river channels through subsurface flow, maintaining streamflow even in the absence of recent precipitation. The hydrological concept of catchment lag time explains the delay between rainfall cessation and observable river level drops, as water percolates through soil and rock layers before reaching the river, with the residence time of water in the watershed varying depending on geology, soil permeability, and catchment size. The river hydrograph’s recession limb illustrates how river discharge decreases slowly after rainfall due to the gradual depletion of groundwater and interflow contributions, rather than an immediate response to surface runoff cessation. Perennial rivers, as opposed to ephemeral or intermittent streams, are characterized by a consistent baseflow component, which is regulated by the regional water table, aquifer recharge rates, and the hydraulic connectivity between groundwater and surface water systems. The apparent constancy of river flow during dry spells is thus a function of integrated watershed hydrology, groundwater-surface water interactions, and the temporal dynamics of water movement through the landscape, rather than a direct and immediate reflection of recent rainfall events.","The persistent flow of rivers during extended dry periods is primarily governed by baseflow, which is the sustained contribution of groundwater to stream channels, maintained by the hydraulic gradient between the saturated zone of an aquifer and the riverbed, even in the absence of recent precipitation. This baseflow is a function of catchment hydrology, where infiltrated precipitation percolates through the vadose zone to recharge local and regional aquifers, which then slowly discharge into river systems via seepage, springs, or hyporheic exchange, thus buffering river discharge against short-term meteorological variability. The lag time between rainfall events and observable changes in river stage is further influenced by the watershed’s storage capacity, soil permeability, antecedent moisture conditions, and the residence time of water within the subsurface, which can range from days to years depending on lithology, topography, and aquifer properties. Additionally, river hydrographs often exhibit a delayed recession limb following storm events due to the gradual release of stored water from both surface and subsurface reservoirs, a process modulated by channel morphology, bank storage, and the connectivity of tributary networks. Consequently, the apparent constancy of river flow during dry spells reflects the integrated hydrological response of the entire drainage basin, with groundwater-surface water interactions playing a critical role in sustaining perennial streamflow and mitigating the immediate effects of precipitation deficits."

The Virtual tour is good, and I don't know why that wasn't an accepted answer.
So I'll throw my answer into the ring. I'll recommend you try the [ NWP and
Forecasting Comet module ](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/bom/intro_nwp/index.htm)
(it's free if to get an account). That'll probably help more than my answer,
which is based around the forecasting classes that I took and my experience as
a forecaster in the university's student-run weather service.

From the outside, the forecast process is a very mysterious thing. But in
reality it is not. Though, it is highly a subjective task and is subject to
some degree of variation per person (hence some people are better forecasters
than others). It also takes a lot of time to do it right. Here is my pattern
if I want to be rigorous.

  1. Know where I am forecasting for. 

Location is important. What do I know about the climatology. Climatology can
give a ""first guess"" on the range of values that can be reasonably considered.
The previous day's weather can also be a good first guess. If I am well
acquainted with the area, then this becomes a shorter and shorter step.

  2. Start with observations. 

What is happening now? What is reality saying? The amount of space that is
looked at needs to be proportionate to the forecast time.

  3. Make inferences on the current state and causes of weather features. 

What patterns are seen? Was map analysis done? Are there certain areas that
are colder than others? Are there places that have clouds and others that
don't have clouds? What does the radar say? Why, why why why why? If you know
the mechanisms that are generating weather now, then you can understand how
they might evolve.

  4. Examine how the weather models have started. 

Before you use a weather model, you should understand it. Garbage in=garbage
out, _sometimes_ . How well did the model do today? If it is overpredicting
temperature right now, will it continue overpredicting the temperature? Will
the errors that occurred upstream yesterday occur today?

  5. Look at how the weather models progress. Question if it aligns with my knowledge and experience. 

Taking a model at face value might work for research purposes (unless you are
researching the model itself), but shouldn't be done on a practical level or
in a rush. What does Model Output Statistics (MOS) say?

  6. Choose the right numbers or features. 

This is probably the step that requires the least amount of explanation.
Though the more intricate the type of forecast, the harder and harder this
becomes. Does it actually require numbers, or is there some sort of GIS
software (like for hurricane trajectory or lightning forecast)?

  7. Verify 

This can't be stated enough. You must verify how well you did. Decisions need
to be made on how the forecast will be verified. What data sources do you know
of for verification? If I could move this up to number 1 and still have this
make sense, I would. Because this is what you should start off with. This
actually goes part and parcel with starting with observations, since
observations are what you start a forecast with. Understand the processes of
why your forecast was off. This will serve you in the future and in the next
forecast.","Meteorologists at weather forecast offices synthesize numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output—including global models like the GFS and ECMWF, regional models such as the NAM and HRRR, and ensemble guidance—with real-time surface and upper-air observations, radar and satellite data, and mesoscale analysis to produce tailored forecasts. Forecasters interrogate model fields such as temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, pressure, and derived indices (e.g., CAPE, CIN, helicity, QPF, PBL height) while assessing model biases, run-to-run consistency, and ensemble spread to gauge forecast confidence and uncertainty. Through the use of advanced visualization and editing tools like AWIPS and the Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE), meteorologists blend model guidance with local climatology, recent trends, and mesoscale features—such as terrain effects, land-sea breezes, and convective initiation—applying scientific judgment and pattern recognition to adjust model output for local impacts. The forecast process culminates in the creation of diverse products, including digital grids, text forecasts, graphical hazard outlooks, and specialized briefings, each tailored to user needs and disseminated via multiple platforms. The skill of the meteorologist is critical in recognizing model limitations, integrating disparate data sources, and communicating uncertainty, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy and relevance beyond raw model output.","The operational workflow of a meteorologist at a weather forecast office involves the synthesis of high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output—such as the Global Forecast System (GFS), North American Mesoscale (NAM), High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models—with real-time surface and upper-air observations, radar and satellite data, and mesoscale analysis to diagnose current atmospheric states and anticipate mesoscale and synoptic-scale evolution. Forecasters interrogate deterministic and ensemble model guidance, scrutinizing parameters such as 500 hPa geopotential heights, vorticity advection, thermal advections, convective available potential energy (CAPE), lifted index, quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF), and boundary layer processes, while also evaluating model biases, initialization errors, and local topographic or land-surface effects that may not be fully resolved by the models. Through the use of advanced visualization and editing platforms like the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) and the Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE), meteorologists integrate model-derived fields with local climatology, real-time mesoscale trends, and pattern recognition skills to adjust and refine forecast grids, producing a suite of forecast products including digital and graphical grids, text-based zone forecasts, hazardous weather outlooks, and probabilistic guidance. The forecaster’s expertise is crucial for interpreting model uncertainty, downscaling coarse model output, and applying conceptual models to phenomena such as convective initiation, frontal passage timing, precipitation type transitions, and local wind effects, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy beyond raw model output. This process is iterative and dynamic, with continuous assimilation of new observational data and model runs, enabling meteorologists to issue timely updates, warnings, and impact-based decision support services tailored to the needs of emergency management, aviation, marine, and public stakeholders."

The accumulation and subsequent burial of plant material in such swampy, anoxic environments are the primary processes for coal formation, known as peatification and coalification, which occurred extensively during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. Geological evidence indicates that significant coal-bearing strata, or coal measures, are present in regions that were once equatorial Pangaean rainforests, such as present-day North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, suggesting similar potential for northern Africa. However, the Sahara's current geology reveals limited coal deposits due to later tectonic uplift, extensive erosion, desertification, and sedimentary cover that have either removed or deeply buried any Paleozoic or Mesozoic coal seams. Thus, while paleoclimatic and paleogeographic reconstructions imply that coal could theoretically exist beneath the Sahara, the region’s complex geological history and lack of significant coal discoveries indicate that any such deposits are rare, deeply buried, or have been destroyed by subsequent geological processes.","During the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic, the supercontinent Pangaea positioned northern Africa adjacent to the Tethys Ocean, subjecting it to prevailing humid onshore paleowinds that facilitated the development of lush, coal-forming equatorial rainforests and peat swamps, as evidenced by paleoclimatic reconstructions and paleobotanical data. The formation of coal requires high primary productivity, abundant plant biomass, and persistent waterlogged, anoxic conditions that inhibit organic matter decomposition, all of which were present in these equatorial Carboniferous and Permian environments. Stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses reveal that extensive Carboniferous and Permian coal measures are widespread across regions that were once part of Pangaea’s equatorial belt, such as present-day North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, and paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that similar conditions likely prevailed in what is now the Sahara. However, subsequent tectonic processes, including the breakup of Pangaea, the northward drift of Africa, and the onset of aridification during the Cenozoic, led to extensive erosion, burial, and overprinting of earlier sedimentary sequences, often obscuring or removing coal-bearing strata from the modern Sahara’s surface geology. Despite this, subsurface geophysical surveys and borehole data have identified Paleozoic sedimentary basins beneath the Sahara, such as the Illizi and Kufra basins, which contain coal-bearing strata, confirming that coal deposits do exist beneath the desert, albeit deeply buried and not exposed at the surface due to subsequent geological processes."

Their methodologies were rooted in scriptural exegesis rather than empirical geochronological techniques, reflecting the prevailing intellectual paradigm prior to the advent of radiometric dating, stratigraphy, and uniformitarianism. Newton, in his ""Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended,"" synthesized biblical data with classical historical sources, employing comparative chronology to reconcile sacred and secular timelines, while Kepler similarly integrated biblical genealogies with astronomical calculations, such as planetary conjunctions, to anchor historical events. These approaches lacked the modern understanding of deep time, isotopic decay systems (e.g., uranium-lead, potassium-argon), and the principles of superposition and faunal succession that underpin contemporary Earth age determinations. Consequently, their chronometric frameworks were constrained by theological and textual interpretations, rather than the physical evidence and radiometric methodologies that later established the Earth's age at approximately 4.54 billion years."

entire span of time before the Cambrian Period. A synonym was ""Azoic"" as this
period was considered lifeless. Later, it was found that the carbon isotope
ratios changed in rocks about 3.8 billion years old between ones that
indicated no life present to ones that indicated life. So ""Azoic"" began to
refer to the ""lifeless"" period before 3.8 billion years and ""Archaeozoic"" for
the ""earliest life"" after that point.

That's the way it stood when Rachel Carson wrote her book. The 1969 World Book

The etymology of ""Archaeozic"" derives from Greek roots—""archaios"" meaning ancient and ""zoic"" meaning life—suggesting a focus on the earliest emergence of life, which aligns with the Archean Eon's significance as the era when the Earth's crust cooled, the first stable continental landmasses formed, and the earliest known life forms, primarily prokaryotic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, appeared. The term ""Archean"" (or ""Archaean"") has supplanted ""Archaeozic"" in modern stratigraphic nomenclature, as standardized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, and is subdivided into the Eoarchean, Paleoarchean, Mesoarchean, and Neoarchean eras.

In summary, ""Archaeozic"" is a historical synonym for the Archean Eon, not a distinct period, and its usage illustrates the evolution of geological and paleobiological classification systems as scientific understanding of Earth's early history and the origins of life has advanced.","The term ""Archaeozic period,"" as employed by Rachel Carson in mid-20th-century literature, represents an archaic nomenclature that has since been superseded by the standardized term ""Archean Eon"" within the geologic time scale, denoting the interval from approximately 4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago, characterized by the formation of the Earth's earliest continental crust, the stabilization of protocontinents, and the emergence of the first known life forms—primarily prokaryotic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria. Etymologically, ""Archaeozic"" derives from Greek roots ""archaios"" (ancient) and ""zoe"" (life), paralleling the construction of other eon names like ""Proterozoic"" and ""Phanerozoic,"" but in contemporary stratigraphy, ""Archean"" is the preferred term, and ""Archaeozic"" is considered obsolete, with no distinct temporal or stratigraphic differentiation between the two. The usage of ""Archaeozic"" reflects historical conventions in geochronology prior to the formalization of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, which now delineates the Archean as an eon subdivided into the Eoarchean, Paleoarchean, Mesoarchean, and Neoarchean eras. The semantic association with ""life"" in ""Archaeozic"" is somewhat misleading, as the Archean is defined more by the absence of complex life and the dominance of microbial biosignatures, stromatolitic structures, and isotopic evidence for early biogenic activity, rather than by the proliferation of visible or multicellular organisms. In summary, ""Archaeozic period"" is a historical synonym for the Archean Eon, reflecting earlier geological terminology rather than a distinct or differently defined interval, and its usage has been discontinued in favor of the precise, internationally recognized stratigraphic nomenclature."

Skimming the paper, I believe the relevance of the wind stress curl is its
relation to ""Ekman pumping"". I haven't found a simple, concise reference for
this, but [ this page ](http://paoc.mit.edu/labguide/ekpump.html) might be a
good start, and [ this page
](https://marine.rutgers.edu/dmcs/ms501/2004/Notes/Wilkin20041028.htm) has a
couple of formulas about wind stress curl. I'll try to summarize here.

When wind blows over water, the top of the water starts moving. It shears
against the water below it, so that water starts moving too. The momentum from
the wind is transferred down into lower layers of the water. This water also
feels the Coriolis force. The direction it ends up moving in depends on the
balance of friction/drag and Coriolis force. On average, the water moves to
the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere; if the wind is blowing
northward, the water moves eastward.

Now imagine you have strong wind blowing northward at one location and weaker
wind to the right of it. The water at the first location moves to the right,
and it does so faster than the water at the second location (because the wind
forcing the water is stronger at the first location). The water converges at
the second location, pushing the water downward. This is how the curl of the
wind stress (the northward wind changing in the east-west direction) is
related to the water convergence (the eastward current changing in the east-
west direction) and hence to water being pushed down or pulled up. Positive
wind stress curl pulls water up; negative wind stress curl pushes it down.

The last relevant part here is that this kind of motion suppresses ocean
mixing. The relevant sentence from that paper is

> The wind stress curl and hence Ekman pumping anomalies were negative, which
> also is consistent with relatively weak entrainment.

""Entrainment"" is how much of the deep, cold ocean water mixes with the
relatively warm upper ocean water, cooling it. The negative wind stress curl
leads to water being pushed down and less deep water mixing with the upper
ocean. The upper ocean stayed warmer, so the whole heat blob lasted longer.","Wind stress curl is a vector quantity in physical oceanography representing the spatial rate of change (specifically, the rotational component) of wind stress applied to the ocean surface, mathematically defined as the curl of the wind stress vector field (∇×τ), where τ is the wind stress. The unit N·m⁻³ (newton per cubic meter) arises from wind stress (force per unit area, N·m⁻²) differentiated with respect to distance (per meter), quantifying the tendency of wind to induce rotational motion in the surface ocean, which is crucial for processes like Ekman pumping and upwelling. A negative wind stress curl indicates a clockwise (anticyclonic) tendency in the Northern Hemisphere, often associated with downwelling, reduced nutrient supply to the surface, and suppression of biological productivity, while a positive curl would induce upwelling and enhanced productivity. The value −0.5×10⁶ N·m⁻³ signifies a relatively strong negative curl, which, although not unprecedented, is atypical and can have significant impacts on ocean circulation, stratification, and heat content, as observed during the 2014 NE Pacific warm anomaly (""The Blob""). Understanding wind stress curl is essential for interpreting large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions, anomalous climate events, and their ecological and biogeochemical consequences.","Wind stress curl is a vector field quantity in physical oceanography representing the spatial rate of change of the wind stress vector, specifically its tendency to induce rotational motion (vorticity) in the ocean surface layer; mathematically, it is the vertical component of the curl of the wind stress vector field, often expressed as ∂τy/∂x − ∂τx/∂y, where τx and τy are the zonal and meridional components of wind stress. The unit N·m⁻³ (newtons per cubic meter) arises because wind stress itself is a force per unit area (N·m⁻²), and the curl operation introduces a spatial derivative (per meter), thus quantifying the torque per unit volume exerted by the wind on the ocean surface. A negative wind stress curl indicates a clockwise (anticyclonic) tendency in the Northern Hemisphere, which is less common than the typical positive (cyclonic) curl associated with Ekman upwelling and divergence, and instead promotes downwelling and convergence of surface waters. The sign and magnitude of wind stress curl are critical in modulating large-scale ocean circulation patterns, such as the formation and maintenance of gyres, the intensity of upwelling or downwelling, and the vertical transport of heat, nutrients, and biogeochemical tracers. In the context of the 2014 NE Pacific warm anomaly, an anomalously negative wind stress curl of −0.5 × 10⁻⁶ N·m⁻³ signified an unusual atmospheric forcing regime that suppressed typical upwelling, enhanced surface water retention, and contributed to the persistence of the marine heatwave known as ""The Blob."""

The calculation of total silica content involves summing the stoichiometric SiO2 contributions from all constituent minerals, converting their chemical formulas to equivalent SiO2 proportions, and expressing the result as a percentage of the total rock mass. This approach is standardized in geochemical and petrological analyses, where major oxide compositions are routinely reported as weight percent (wt%) oxides, not as volume percent, due to the variable densities and molar volumes of different minerals and the need for direct comparability. The use of weight percent SiO2 as the basis for classification is rooted in both analytical convention and the practicalities of whole-rock geochemical analysis, typically performed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) methods, which yield results in mass units. Thus, the persilicic, mesosilicic, and hyposilicic character of a rock is determined by the total mass fraction of SiO2, encompassing all sources of silica within the mineral assemblage, and not by the volumetric proportion of silica-bearing phases.","In igneous petrology, the classification of rocks according to their silica (SiO₂) content—persilicic (acidic, >65% SiO₂), mesosilicic (intermediate, 52–65% SiO₂), and hyposilicic (basic, <52% SiO₂)—is based on the total weight percent of SiO₂ present in the rock, irrespective of whether the silica occurs as free quartz or is structurally incorporated within silicate minerals such as feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, or feldspathoids. The calculation of SiO₂ content is universally performed on a weight percent (wt%) basis, derived from whole-rock geochemical analyses (typically X-ray fluorescence or ICP-MS), which quantify the mass of SiO₂ relative to the total mass of the rock sample, thereby integrating all sources of silica, including those bound within complex mineral lattices like anorthite (CaAl₂Si₂O₈), where each formula unit contributes two Si atoms to the total silica budget. This weight-based approach is essential because mineralogical modes (volume percentages of minerals) do not directly translate to chemical composition due to variable mineral densities and stoichiometries, making weight percent a more accurate and standardized metric for geochemical classification and comparison. The use of weight percent SiO₂ as a classificatory criterion is foundational in the TAS (Total Alkali-Silica) diagram and the IUGS (International Union of Geological Sciences) system, which underpin global nomenclature and facilitate petrogenetic interpretations, tectonic discrimination, and magmatic series delineation. Thus, in all standard geochemical and petrological contexts, the SiO₂ content used to define the acidic, intermediate, or basic character of a rock refers explicitly to the total mass fraction of silica, not its volumetric proportion, ensuring consistency in classification and facilitating meaningful geochemical and petrogenetic comparisons across diverse lithologies."

The treeline, or timberline, marks the upper ecological limit for tree growth, above which environmental conditions—such as low temperatures, high winds, and short frost-free periods—prevent the establishment of continuous forests, giving way to subalpine or alpine tundra.

You are correct. If elevation $\eta(t)$ is the measured quantity (units of
$m$), the Fourier transform of wave variance $\eta^2$ yields spectrum $S(f)$
with the units of $m^2/Hz$, or if you are working with angular frequency
$\omega = 2\pi f$, it yields $S(\omega)$ with the units of $m^2/rad/Hz$.

Physically, integrating S(ω) over all angular frequencies, ∫S(ω)dω, yields the total variance of the sea surface elevation, which is equivalent to the mean square wave height and has units of m², confirming the dimensional consistency. The spectral density function S(ω) describes how the energy or variance of the surface elevation is partitioned across different frequency components, reflecting the stochastic and multi-scale nature of wind-generated ocean waves. In this context, the m² component denotes the squared amplitude (variance) of the surface displacement, while the (rad/s)⁻¹ component indicates the density per unit angular frequency, ensuring that the integral over frequency recovers the total variance. This framework is foundational in oceanography and wave modeling, as it enables the characterization of sea states, calculation of significant wave height (H_s = 4√variance), and the prediction of wave energy flux, all of which are directly linked to the spectral density's physical interpretation and units.","In ocean wave spectral models such as the Pierson-Moskowitz and JONSWAP spectra, the spectral density function S(ω), typically expressed in units of m²/(rad/s), quantifies the distribution of wave energy or variance of sea surface elevation per unit angular frequency, where the m² component arises from the variance of the sea surface elevation η(t), which has units of meters, and thus its variance, ⟨η²⟩, has units of m². The spectral density S(ω) is defined such that integrating S(ω) over all angular frequencies yields the total variance of the sea surface elevation, i.e., ∫₀^∞ S(ω)dω = ⟨η²⟩, thereby ensuring dimensional consistency, as the integral of m²/(rad/s) over rad/s results in m², directly corresponding to the physical variance of the surface elevation. This variance is fundamentally linked to the significant wave height Hs through the relationship Hs ≈ 4√⟨η²⟩, making S(ω) a central quantity in characterizing sea state and wave energy content. The use of angular frequency (rad/s) rather than linear frequency (Hz) in the denominator reflects the spectral representation's dependence on the chosen frequency domain, with corresponding adjustments in units (e.g., m²/Hz for linear frequency spectra). Thus, the m² in the units of S(ω) encapsulates the physical meaning of the spectrum as a measure of how the variance (energy) of the sea surface elevation is distributed across different frequency components, serving as a foundational descriptor in ocean wave climatology, forecasting, and engineering applications."

I am assuming you are asking for the case of sea level being 200m higher

isostasy model: [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy#Airy
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy#Airy)

Applied to a water column over the mantle, you have to replace $\rho_c$ with
your $\rho_w$. The total increase in ocean depth is $x = b_1 + h_1$, where
$h_1$ are the 200 m extra sea level and $b_1$ is the depth increase to
isostasy. Using the equation given in the link: $$ x = \frac{h_1
\rho_w}{\rho_m - \rho_w} + h_1, $$

giving $x =$ 287 m","The problem concerns isostatic adjustment of ocean basins in response to a historical sea level rise of 200 meters, requiring calculation of the resulting increase in ocean basin depth (subsidence) due to the added water load. Isostatic equilibrium is governed by Archimedes’ principle, where the mass of the added water column (density ρw = 1000 kg/m³) is compensated by downward displacement of mantle material (density ρm = 3300 kg/m³), leading to the relation Δx = (ρw/ρm) * Δh, where Δh is the sea level rise. The calculation x = (1000/3300) * 200 m = 60.6 m is correct for the amount the basin subsides into the mantle, but the total increase in water depth above the original basin floor is the sum of the sea level rise and the isostatic subsidence, i.e., 200 m + 60.6 m = 260.6 m, not 290 m. The confusion arises from conflating the isostatic response (subsidence) with the total water depth increase; the isostatic adjustment only accounts for the additional depression of the basin, while the sea level rise itself directly adds to the water column. The expected value of 290 m may stem from a misapplication of the Airy isostasy model or an incorrect assumption about the densities or the nature of the compensation column, but with the given densities, the correct total increase in ocean depth is 260.6 m, reflecting both the direct sea level rise and the isostatic response.","The problem addresses the isostatic response of oceanic lithosphere to an increase in sea level, specifically quantifying the resultant deepening of ocean basins due to the added water load, using the principle of isostatic equilibrium and the concept of Airy isostasy. The calculation utilizes the compensation column approach, equating the mass of the added water column (with density ρw = 1000 kg m⁻³ and thickness 200 m) to the mass of mantle displaced, yielding x = (ρw × 200 m) / ρm = 60.6 m, where ρm = 3300 kg m⁻³ is the mantle density. However, this approach neglects the fact that the ocean basin subsides not only by the amount of mantle displaced but also by the thickness of the added water itself, as the total depth increase is the sum of the water column and the isostatic subsidence, leading to x_total = 200 m + (ρw × 200 m) / ρm ≈ 260.6 m. The expectation of 290 m likely arises from an alternative isostatic model or a misapplication of the principle, possibly confusing the total depth change with the isostatic adjustment alone, or neglecting the density contrast between water and mantle in the calculation. The correct isostatic adjustment requires integrating both the direct addition of water and the compensatory downward flexure of the lithosphere, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for both the load thickness and the density ratio in isostatic calculations within the context of eustatic sea level changes and lithospheric flexure."

& Gruber ( _TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain_ )
provides a method to partition direct and diffuse from ERA-Interim. The
results could easily be applied to ERA5.

It uses a clearness index approximation from Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010)

$k_t = SW / SW_{toa}$  (eq C11) where  $ SW_{toa} $  is the shortwave at the
top-of-atmosphere.

then,

$SW_{diffuse} = 0.952 - 1.041 e^{-exp(2.3 - 4.702k_t)}$  (eq C12)

You should be able to get top-of-atmosphere SW from ERA5, or possibly
calculate it based on solar geometry.","The calculation of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as described in the referenced paper requires the separation of direct and diffuse components of shortwave (SW) radiation, yet ERA5 reanalysis data provides only total downward surface solar radiation (SSRD), which is the sum of both direct and diffuse components, without explicit partitioning. The direct and diffuse SW components are critical for accurate mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) estimation, which in turn is essential for UTCI computation, as Tmrt is sensitive to the angular distribution and intensity of incoming solar radiation. To estimate the direct and diffuse fractions from ERA5 or similar datasets, radiative transfer parameterizations or empirical models such as the Erbs, Reindl, or Liu and Jordan models can be employed, which use inputs like total global horizontal irradiance (GHI), solar zenith angle, and atmospheric conditions (e.g., cloud cover, aerosol optical depth, water vapor) to partition the total SW flux into its direct (beam) and diffuse components. Alternatively, the clearness index (ratio of surface to top-of-atmosphere SW radiation) can be used in conjunction with empirical relationships to estimate the diffuse fraction, though this introduces additional uncertainty due to the lack of explicit atmospheric optical properties in ERA5. For rigorous UTCI applications, it is recommended to supplement ERA5 data with ancillary information (e.g., aerosol, cloud, and water vapor profiles) or to use radiative transfer models (such as libRadtran or SMARTS) driven by ERA5 meteorological variables to derive the required direct and diffuse SW fluxes, thereby ensuring the physical consistency and accuracy of the Tmrt and UTCI calculations.","The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) calculation, as described in the referenced paper, necessitates partitioning the total downward surface solar radiation (shortwave, SW) into its direct and diffuse components, yet ERA5 reanalysis data only provides aggregated surface solar radiation downwards (SSRD), lacking explicit separation of direct (beam) and diffuse fluxes. This limitation arises because ERA5, based on the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System, archives SSRD as the sum of direct and diffuse shortwave irradiance at the surface, precluding direct retrieval of the individual components required for radiative transfer modeling and human biometeorological indices like UTCI. To estimate the direct and diffuse SW components from ERA5 or similar datasets, one must employ radiative transfer parameterizations or empirical models that utilize available variables such as total downward SW, solar zenith angle, atmospheric transmissivity, cloud cover fraction, aerosol optical depth, and surface albedo, with approaches including the Erbs, Liu and Jordan, or Reindl models, which relate the diffuse fraction to clearness index (ratio of global to extraterrestrial solar irradiance). These methods require calculation of the clear-sky global horizontal irradiance and the clearness index using ERA5’s SSRD, top-of-atmosphere solar radiation, and ancillary meteorological fields, enabling partitioning into direct and diffuse components through established empirical relationships, albeit with inherent uncertainties due to the absence of direct beam measurements and potential biases in cloud and aerosol representation. For rigorous UTCI computation, it is essential to document the chosen partitioning methodology, quantify associated uncertainties, and, where possible, validate the derived direct and diffuse components against ground-based radiometric observations or higher-resolution radiative transfer model outputs to ensure fidelity in the human thermal stress assessment."

The mass of Earth's atmosphere is 3,400,000 times the mass of CO  2  that
industries produces each year in the US.","Despite anthropogenic emissions of approximately 1.5 billion metric tons of CO₂ annually in the US, atmospheric carbon dioxide remains a trace gas at roughly 0.04% (400 ppm) due to the immense total mass of the atmosphere (about 5.15 × 10¹⁸ kg), the vastness of global carbon sinks such as oceans and terrestrial biospheres, and the dynamic processes of the global carbon cycle, including photosynthesis, oceanic absorption, and weathering. The relatively small proportion of CO₂ is a function of both the dilution effect within the atmospheric reservoir and the fact that, historically, pre-industrial CO₂ levels were even lower (~280 ppm), with the recent anthropogenic increase representing a significant relative, but still minor absolute, change in atmospheric composition. The persistence and accumulation of CO₂ are governed by its atmospheric residence time (decades to centuries), meaning that while annual emissions are large in human terms, they are incremental relative to the atmospheric mass and are partially offset by natural sequestration mechanisms. The greenhouse effect is highly sensitive to these small compositional changes because CO₂ is a potent infrared absorber, so even minor increases in concentration have outsized impacts on radiative forcing and global climate systems. Thus, the apparent paradox of large emissions yet low atmospheric concentration is resolved by considering the scale of the atmosphere, the buffering capacity of natural sinks, and the cumulative, rather than instantaneous, nature of anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle.","Despite anthropogenic emissions of approximately 1.5 billion metric tons of CO₂ annually from US industries, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide remains at about 0.04% (400 ppm) due to the immense total mass of the atmosphere, which is roughly 5.15 × 10¹⁸ kg, rendering annual emissions a minuscule fraction of the whole. The persistence of low CO₂ concentration is further governed by the dynamic equilibrium of the global carbon cycle, wherein atmospheric carbon dioxide is continually exchanged with terrestrial biospheres, oceanic reservoirs, and lithospheric sinks through processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, oceanic dissolution, and carbonate sedimentation. The residence time of CO₂ in the atmosphere, typically estimated at several decades to centuries, allows for partial sequestration by natural sinks, mitigating the immediate proportional increase in atmospheric concentration despite ongoing emissions. Historically, pre-industrial CO₂ levels were about 280 ppm, and the observed increase to current levels reflects the cumulative effect of anthropogenic emissions over centuries, rather than annual increments, highlighting the inertia and buffering capacity of Earth's biogeochemical systems. Thus, the relatively low atmospheric proportion of CO₂, despite substantial industrial output, is a function of the vast atmospheric mass, the moderating influence of carbon sinks, and the temporal lag inherent in geochemical cycling and atmospheric mixing processes."

If the Sun were drawn to scale relative to Earth and placed at the correct average distance (~149.6 million km), the Sun would appear as a tiny disc in the sky, subtending an angle of about 0.5 degrees, which is why the entire Earth is not illuminated simultaneously—only the hemisphere facing the Sun experiences daylight due to the geometry of parallel rays and the Earth's curvature. The misconception that the Earth would be ""covered in daylight all the time"" if the Sun were scaled up stems from a misunderstanding of angular diameter and the inverse-square law of light propagation, which ensures that only half the spherical Earth is illuminated at any given moment, regardless of the Sun’s actual size, provided the distance remains constant. The day-night cycle is governed by the Earth's rotation on its axis, not by the absolute size of the Sun, and the terminator (the line dividing day and night) is always present due to the directional nature of sunlight and the spherical geometry of the Earth. Thus, accurate scale modeling and understanding of astronomical distances, angular size, and the mechanics of illumination are essential to dispel such misconceptions, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between illustrative diagrams and physical reality in astronomy education.","The misconception that the Earth would be perpetually illuminated if the Sun were drawn to scale relative to the Earth arises from a misunderstanding of angular diameter, astronomical distances, and the inverse square law of light propagation.

This small angular size means that, despite its immense physical dimensions, the Sun subtends a tiny fraction of the sky, allowing for the alternation of day and night due to Earth’s axial rotation, with only half the planet illuminated at any given time. Diagrammatic representations that depict the Sun and Earth at similar scales or in close proximity are not to scale and serve only pedagogical or illustrative purposes, often leading to misconceptions about the spatial relationships and the resulting illumination geometry.

The category ""other gases"" may not solely include other naturally occurring
gases extracted from the Earth.

predominantly methane, extracted from the Earth.

[ Coal gas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gas) , which was manufactured
from coal and largely consists of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, is no
longer manufactured or used.

Another type of gas that could be included in the category is [ biogas
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas) , which is a manufactured gas made
from biological waste products, such as: manure, sewage, food waste and green
waste. Biogas is predominantly methane.","Natural gas, primarily composed of methane (CH₄), is extracted from subsurface reservoirs and often contains varying proportions of ethane, propane, butane, pentanes, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and helium; during processing, heavier hydrocarbons such as propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀) are separated as natural gas liquids (NGLs), while methane remains the principal component for pipeline distribution. The ""Other gases"" category in US electricity generation statistics, as reported by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), typically refers to manufactured or byproduct gases such as blast furnace gas, coke oven gas, refinery gas, and synthetic gases (syngas) produced from coal gasification or biomass, rather than naturally occurring earth-sourced gases. These ""Other gases"" are not directly extracted from the Earth in significant quantities but are generated as industrial byproducts or through chemical conversion processes, and their contribution to electricity generation is minor, accounting for less than 1% of the US mix. Natural propane and other heavier hydrocarbons are present in natural gas reservoirs but are usually separated and marketed as fuels or feedstocks rather than combusted directly for electricity generation, thus not classified under ""Other gases"" in power generation statistics. In summary, the ""Other gases"" fraction in US electricity generation is not attributable to naturally occurring earth-sourced gases like propane or butane, but rather to industrially produced or recovered gases, with natural gas (methane-rich) remaining the dominant earth-derived gaseous fuel for power generation.","Natural gas, a geogenic hydrocarbon gas mixture dominated by methane (CH₄) with variable proportions of ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈), butanes (C₄H₁₀), and trace non-hydrocarbon gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N₂), hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), and helium (He), is extracted from subsurface reservoirs where these constituents exist in varying ratios due to thermogenic or biogenic processes. The ""Other gases"" category in US electricity generation statistics, as reported by the EIA and referenced in the BBC graphic, encompasses a range of non-methane gaseous fuels, including manufactured gases (such as syngas from coal gasification), refinery gases, and landfill or biogas, but also includes naturally occurring earth-derived gases that are not classified as conventional natural gas. While heavier alkanes like propane and butane are present in natural gas reservoirs as natural gas liquids (NGLs), they are typically separated during processing and marketed as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) rather than being combusted directly for electricity generation, thus their direct contribution to the ""Other gases"" category is minimal. Other naturally occurring earth-sourced gases that may contribute to this category include non-hydrocarbon gases such as hydrogen (H₂) from certain geologic settings, or rare instances of direct use of coalbed methane, landfill gas, or geothermal gases, but these sources are quantitatively minor compared to conventional natural gas. Therefore, the ""Other gases"" fraction in electricity generation statistics primarily reflects the combustion of non-conventional, often anthropogenically produced or separated, gaseous fuels rather than significant direct use of naturally occurring earth-sourced gases other than methane-rich natural gas."
"What is a temperature inversion and can it trap smog/pollution?
Just as the title says, I heard about this term but am not sure how it works."," A temperature inversion is where the air temperature rises with altitude.

Normally, temperature broadly [ decreases with altitude
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate) , and convection is effective:
locally warmer air will rise, and cooler air will fall. A [ temperature
inversion ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_\(meteorology\)) is where
the air temperature **rises** with altitude. This means that convection is
less effective because the air above is already warmer, and so there is less
mixing of air between altitudes.

Since pollution is generally produced at ground level, temperature inversions
can trap the pollution (e.g. smog) at ground level.","A temperature inversion is a meteorological phenomenon in which a layer of warmer air overlays a layer of cooler air near the Earth's surface, effectively reversing the normal vertical temperature gradient where air typically cools with altitude. This stratification inhibits vertical mixing and convection, causing atmospheric stability that prevents pollutants such as smog, particulate matter, and other airborne contaminants from dispersing upward into the troposphere. Temperature inversions commonly occur during clear nights with calm winds, especially in valleys or urban basins, where radiative cooling of the ground rapidly chills the surface air, while the air above remains relatively warmer. The trapped pollutants accumulate within the inversion layer, leading to elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and other hazardous substances, which can exacerbate respiratory health issues and reduce visibility. The dissipation of a temperature inversion typically requires a change in weather conditions, such as increased wind, precipitation, or solar heating, which restores normal atmospheric mixing and allows pollutants to disperse.","A temperature inversion, or thermal inversion, is an atmospheric phenomenon wherein a layer of warmer air overlays a layer of cooler air near the Earth's surface, effectively reversing the typical environmental lapse rate in the troposphere and inhibiting vertical mixing. This stratification creates a stable atmospheric condition that suppresses convection, thereby preventing the dispersion of surface-level pollutants such as smog, particulate matter, and anthropogenic emissions. The trapped cooler air mass beneath the inversion acts as a lid, allowing concentrations of pollutants to accumulate to hazardous levels, particularly in urban basins or valleys where topography further restricts air movement. Temperature inversions are often associated with radiative cooling during clear nights, subsidence from high-pressure systems, or coastal upwelling, and their persistence can exacerbate air quality issues, leading to acute episodes of photochemical smog and respiratory health hazards. The phenomenon is critical in urban climatology and air pollution meteorology, as it directly influences the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics, pollutant dispersion models, and the formulation of environmental mitigation strategies."
"In meteorology the seasons always start at the beginning of the month the astronomical seasons start.
The astronomical seasons start around the 21st in a month so I guess it would make more sense to start the meteorological season at the first day of the month following the start of the astronomical season.
Another more logical reason to do this: for example the meteorological winter start at December 1 and ends at February 28 (or 29) in the next year so meteorology actually measures in broken years. Should the meteorological winter start at January 1 and end at March 31 then all seasons do exactly fit in the same year.

Meteorological seasons are based on temperature, whereas astronomical seasons
are based on the position of the earth in relation to the sun. So
meteorological winter is the three coldest months of the year (December,
January, and February) and meteorological summer is the three warmest months
of the year (June, July, and August). More information can be found on this [
NOAA web site ](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/meteorological-versus-

The rationale for starting meteorological seasons at the beginning of the month rather than aligning with astronomical events or the calendar year is rooted in the need for operational simplicity, ease of record-keeping, and the alignment with the most significant temperature changes, which tend to lag behind astronomical markers due to thermal inertia. While defining meteorological winter as January through March would align seasonal periods with the calendar year, it would disrupt the established convention, complicate long-term climatological datasets, and misalign with the coldest three-month period in the Northern Hemisphere, which is more accurately captured by December through February. The current system, though it results in seasons crossing calendar years, is not arbitrary but is optimized for climatological coherence, data continuity, and practical utility in weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and research. This distinction between meteorological and astronomical seasons is fundamental for understanding temporal frameworks in climatology, the rationale behind data segmentation, and the operational needs of meteorological services.","The delineation of meteorological seasons—wherein winter spans December 1 to February 28/29, spring March 1 to May 31, summer June 1 to August 31, and autumn September 1 to November 30—arises from the necessity for climatological consistency, statistical uniformity, and ease of temporal aggregation in climate data analysis, rather than alignment with astronomical solstices and equinoxes, which typically occur around the 21st of their respective months and are subject to minor annual fluctuations due to orbital mechanics and leap year adjustments. Meteorological seasons are defined by the Gregorian calendar months to facilitate the calculation of monthly and seasonal climate normals, anomalies, and long-term averages, which are foundational for comparative climatology, trend detection, and operational meteorological services, as these periods correspond more closely to the annual temperature cycle and the lagged response of the Earth's surface and atmosphere to solar insolation. The alternative proposal of aligning meteorological seasons with the calendar year (e.g., winter as January–March) would disrupt the established convention of using contiguous three-month periods that best represent the thermal characteristics of each season in the mid-latitudes, and would complicate the continuity of climate records and the interpretation of seasonal statistics, especially in the context of international standards set by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The selection of December–February for meteorological winter, for instance, captures the coldest quarter in the Northern Hemisphere, aligning with the climatological minima in temperature, whereas a January–March definition would straddle two distinct thermal regimes and undermine the coherence of seasonal datasets. Thus, the meteorological convention is not arbitrary but is a pragmatic, data-driven standardization that optimizes the temporal resolution and comparability of climate data, supports robust seasonal forecasting, and underpins the reproducibility of earth system science research."
"I'm slightly confused by how thermohaline circulation works in the Earth's oceans. Is it different for surface water as opposed to deep water? I thought that warm water from the equator is transported to the poles, cools down, and then returns to lower latitudes. Is my thinking incorrect? Isn't water denser near the equator because of higher salinity? How does this impact the ocean circulation?","Salinity and temperature affect the density of seawater. Cooling water with fixed salinity makes it heavier and sink, while removing water through evaporation or ice formation increases salinity and density. This process, known as thermohaline circulation, causes surface water in the tropics to become saline but less dense due to high temperatures, while in colder climates, the water cools down and the high salinity causes it to sink. In polar regions, ice formation increases the density of surface water by leaving salt behind in the sea.",82,['N/A'],"['thermohaline_circulation/ocean_conveyor_belt_htm.txt'

Salinity and temperature both affects the density of sea water. When water
with a fixed salinity cools down, it becomes heavier and sinks. In the same
way, when vapor or ice removes water from sea water, the remains is more
saline and heavier. Thermohaline circulation can work as you describe. Surface
water in the tropics is saline, due to evaporation, but warm due to high
temperature in the atmosphere and therefor low density. As it reach colder
climate (less solar energy per area), it cools down and the high salinity
makes it sink. Surface water in polar regions also get heavier as ice is
formed of water and leave the salt behind in the sea.

This is very simplified model, you can read more on the topic [ here
](http://oceanmotion.org/html/background/ocean-conveyor-belt.htm) and [ here
](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/05conveyor1.html) .","Thermohaline circulation, also known as the global ocean conveyor belt, is a deep-ocean process driven by differences in seawater density, which is controlled by both temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), and it operates distinctly from wind-driven surface currents such as the Gulf Stream. Warm, less dense surface water from equatorial regions is transported poleward, where it cools and, in regions like the North Atlantic, increases in salinity due to processes such as sea ice formation and evaporation, making it denser and causing it to sink, forming North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This dense, cold water then flows equatorward at depth, eventually upwelling in other ocean basins, completing the global circulation loop, and thus, deep-water movement is largely density-driven, while surface currents are more influenced by wind and the Coriolis effect. Contrary to the assumption that equatorial waters are denser due to higher salinity, equatorial surface waters are generally less dense because their higher temperatures more than offset any salinity effects, and polar waters become denser primarily through cooling and increased salinity from ice formation. The interplay between temperature, salinity, and density is fundamental to the vertical stratification and large-scale movement of ocean water masses, and disruptions to this balance, such as freshwater input from melting ice, can significantly impact global climate and ocean circulation patterns.","Thermohaline circulation, often referred to as the global ocean conveyor belt, is a density-driven process governed by spatial variations in seawater temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), resulting in the formation of distinct water masses and the vertical and horizontal redistribution of heat, nutrients, and gases throughout the world’s oceans. Surface currents, primarily wind-driven and exemplified by the Gulf Stream, transport warm, relatively less dense water poleward, where it cools, increases in salinity through processes such as evaporation and sea ice formation, and consequently becomes denser, ultimately sinking in regions of deepwater formation like the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean—a process termed deepwater convection or downwelling. Contrary to the misconception that equatorial waters are denser due to higher salinity, equatorial surface waters are typically less dense because elevated temperatures reduce density more significantly than any salinity increase from evaporation, and precipitation in equatorial regions often offsets salinity gains. The resulting deep, cold, and saline water masses, such as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), flow equatorward at depth, gradually upwelling in other ocean basins, thereby completing the global overturning circulation and facilitating the meridional transport of heat and biogeochemical tracers. This dynamic interplay between surface and deep ocean circulation is fundamental to Earth’s climate regulation, carbon cycle, and the distribution of marine life, with perturbations in thermohaline processes implicated in abrupt climate events and long-term oceanographic variability."

While the unique combination of rapid burial, fine-grained ash, and subsequent preservation conditions at Vesuvius has rarely been replicated, archaeologists and volcanologists have investigated other eruption sites—such as Santorini (Thera), Mount St. Helens, Krakatoa, and Mount Tambora—for evidence of similar entombment and preservation, though the survival of voids suitable for casting is uncommon due to differences in eruption dynamics, sedimentology, and post-depositional processes. In some cases, such as at Akrotiri on Santorini, volcanic deposits have preserved architectural and artifact details but not organic body voids, likely due to slower burial rates, higher temperatures, or subsequent erosion and bioturbation, which preclude the formation or survival of intact cavities. The search for comparable sites involves interdisciplinary methodologies, including stratigraphic analysis, geoarchaeology, forensic taphonomy, and advanced imaging techniques like ground-penetrating radar and computed tomography, to detect potential voids or organic residues within volcanic deposits. Discovering such sites could yield unprecedented paleoanthropological and paleozoological insights into ancient biota, human behavior during catastrophic events, and the interaction between societies and volcanic hazards, but the rarity of the precise taphonomic and sedimentological conditions required for cast formation makes Pompeii and Herculaneum exceptional rather than typical in the global volcanic record.","The phenomenon of victims—human or faunal—being entombed in volcanic ash and subsequently leaving voids that can be cast to reveal their forms is most famously exemplified by the Roman sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, where pyroclastic surges and ashfall from the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius preserved detailed negative impressions of bodies, later filled with plaster to create anthropological and taphonomic casts. While the Vesuvian sites remain the archetype, analogous discoveries have been sought and, to a limited extent, documented at other volcanic localities, such as the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia, where rapid burial by ignimbrite and tephra preserved some human and architectural remains, though the preservation of voids suitable for casting is rare due to variable eruption dynamics, burial rates, and post-depositional diagenesis. In volcanic settings, the formation of such voids requires rapid, high-temperature ash or pyroclastic density currents that both kill and entomb organisms, followed by the decomposition of organic material in an anoxic environment, leaving behind cavities within indurated tuff or ash layers, a process contingent on factors such as grain size, temperature, moisture content, and subsequent lithification. While paleontological analogs exist—such as the preservation of dinosaur trackways or the Laetoli hominin footprints in volcanic ash—these typically record external impressions rather than voids left by decayed bodies, and thus do not lend themselves to casting in the manner of Pompeii. Ongoing volcanological, geoarchaeological, and forensic investigations continue to monitor active and historic eruption sites for similar preservation phenomena, employing stratigraphic analysis, remote sensing, and excavation to identify potential anthropogenic or faunal remains entombed in volcaniclastic deposits, with the hope of uncovering new insights into past biotic communities, mortuary events, and eruption impacts on ancient societies."

Typically, if you are trying to model something like the hydroxyl radical, you
would use a [ box-model like MECCA ](http://www.atmos-chem-

To ensure numerical stability and accuracy, chemical mechanisms are often integrated using implicit or semi-implicit numerical solvers, such as backward Euler or Rosenbrock methods, which are specifically designed for stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and allow stable integration over time steps much larger than the radical’s lifetime. Operator splitting techniques are commonly employed, separating fast chemical kinetics from slower transport and physical processes, and within the chemical operator, quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) or steady-state assumptions for OH are frequently invoked, treating its concentration as instantaneously adjusting to production and loss terms, thereby circumventing the need to resolve its microsecond-scale dynamics directly. The use of reduced chemical mechanisms or lumped species can further mitigate stiffness by aggregating fast-reacting intermediates, while adaptive time-stepping and sub-stepping within the chemistry module can be used when higher accuracy is required for specific processes. Thus, the problem of numerical stability is not ignored but is addressed through a combination of stiff ODE solvers, steady-state approximations, operator splitting, and mechanism reduction, ensuring that the modeled concentrations of OH and its influence on atmospheric oxidation capacity are both numerically stable and physically realistic within the constraints of large-scale atmospheric models.","The hydroxyl radical (OH), a highly reactive atmospheric oxidant with a typical atmospheric lifetime on the order of microseconds, presents a significant challenge for numerical stability in atmospheric chemistry and air quality models, as the model time steps (often minutes to hours) vastly exceed the radical’s chemical timescale.

These approaches allow the model to maintain numerical stability and accuracy without requiring prohibitively small time steps that would otherwise be dictated by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for explicit solvers in the presence of fast-reacting species. The QSSA, in particular, assumes that the production and loss rates of OH are balanced over the model time step, enabling the radical’s concentration to be algebraically diagnosed from the slower-evolving concentrations of its precursors and reaction partners, such as ozone, water vapor, and volatile organic compounds. This treatment is justified by the radical’s negligible accumulation and the dominance of its instantaneous reactivity, ensuring that the model captures the correct integrated effect of OH chemistry on longer-lived species and atmospheric composition. Thus, the problem of numerical instability is not ignored but is systematically addressed through advanced numerical methods and chemical mechanism reduction strategies, which are foundational to the fidelity of atmospheric chemical transport models and weather prediction systems."
"The image below is included in the BBC article Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor. Apparently this phenomenon is sometimes called a ""fog-bow"" and is characterized by the washing out of perceived color relative to a conventional rainbow.
Is this related to the geometry (fog being far closer to the viewer) or properties of the droplets themselves?

The reason why [ fog bows ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_bow) lack
colour, compared to rainbows, is due to the size of the drops of water.

Fog is composed of very small drops of water - less than 0.05 mm diameter.
Because of this the wavelength of light is critical, with diffraction smearing
out colours that the larger drops of water in a rainbow would make.","A fogbow, also known as a white rainbow or ghost rainbow, is an atmospheric optical phenomenon analogous to a conventional rainbow but distinguished by its pale or nearly colorless appearance, primarily due to the microphysical properties of the water droplets composing the fog. The critical factor is the small droplet size, typically less than 0.05 mm in diameter, which results in pronounced diffraction effects that broaden and overlap the colored bands, effectively washing out the spectral separation seen in larger raindrop-induced rainbows. The geometry of the phenomenon remains similar to that of a standard rainbow, with the bow forming at an angle of approximately 42 degrees from the antisolar point, but the proximity of fog to the observer can make the bow appear larger and more diffuse. The lack of vivid coloration is fundamentally a consequence of Mie scattering and the dominance of diffraction over refraction and reflection in small droplets, which causes the constituent wavelengths of visible light to blend into a white or faintly colored arc. Thus, the washed-out appearance of a fogbow is primarily attributable to the microphysical properties—specifically the small size—of fog droplets, rather than their proximity or the geometric configuration alone.","The phenomenon known as a ""fogbow,"" often termed a white rainbow, arises primarily due to the microphysical properties of the water droplets constituting fog, specifically their diminutive size—typically less than 50 micrometers in diameter—compared to the much larger raindrops responsible for conventional rainbows.

Due to their small radii, the wavelength-dependent separation of visible light (dispersion) is significantly diminished, resulting in the superposition and blending of spectral colors, which manifests as a broad, pale, or nearly colorless arc rather than the vivid, multi-hued bands of a typical rainbow. The proximity of fog to the observer does not directly alter the optical geometry but may enhance the visibility and apparent size of the fogbow due to the increased density and uniformity of the droplet field in the observer’s immediate vicinity. Thus, the washed-out appearance of a fogbow is fundamentally attributable to the interplay between droplet size, which amplifies diffraction and suppresses chromatic dispersion, and the resultant optical path differences, rather than to the spatial relationship between the fog and the observer."

Your idea has merit. Shale is classified by geologists as being a mudstone. It
is composed of silt and clay sized minerals.

According to this [ geology website ](http://geology.com/rocks/shale.shtml) ,
shales can be crushed to produce a clay and then mixed with water. These days,
items that were once made from natural clay, such as terracotta pots and tiles
for roofs, are now made from crushed shale.

Extra Information

One thing to be mindful of is that clays expand when wet and contract when
dry. Anything you make from it, such as bricks, that isn't baked or protected
from water by a sealed coating will expand and contract according to it
moisture content.

Another application which you may want to consider is to supply crushed shale
as a garden mulch or other such landscaping product.","Shale, a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay minerals and silt-sized particles, is generally unsuitable for traditional sun-dried mud brick (adobe) production due to its low plasticity, poor cohesion, and tendency to fragment or delaminate when dried without sufficient binding agents. Traditional adobe bricks rely on loamy soil, which contains a balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay, providing both structural integrity and workability, often supplemented with organic fibers such as straw to enhance tensile strength and reduce cracking during drying. Shale’s mineralogical composition and laminar structure result in poor water retention and limited particle interlocking, making it challenging to form stable, unfired bricks unless blended with a significant proportion of clay-rich loam or other cohesive soils to improve plasticity and binding properties. Without access to a kiln for firing, any attempt to utilize shale in brickmaking would require experimental mixing ratios with local loam and organic stabilizers, followed by rigorous sun-drying trials to assess mechanical strength, durability, and resistance to weathering. Alternative uses for waste shale on your land include its application as aggregate for paths or driveways, as a drainage layer in landscaping, or as a substrate for certain reclamation or habitat restoration projects, provided environmental considerations such as potential acidity or heavy metal content are evaluated.","Shale, a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay minerals and silt-sized particles, is a byproduct of coal mining spoil heaps and presents unique challenges and opportunities for reuse due to its fissility, low plasticity, and tendency to disintegrate upon weathering. In the context of earthen construction, traditional sun-dried mud bricks (adobe) rely on a balanced mixture of clay, silt, sand, and organic temper (such as straw) to achieve optimal cohesion, plasticity, and shrinkage control during drying; shale, however, lacks the cohesive and plastic properties of loamy soils, making it suboptimal as a sole constituent for unfired brick production. The addition of water to raw shale typically results in poor workability and weak agglomeration, as the rock fragments do not bind effectively without a significant proportion of clay minerals or a binding matrix, suggesting that blending shale with loam or clay-rich soil could improve brick integrity, though the resulting mechanical strength and durability would likely remain inferior to conventional adobe unless stabilized with additives such as lime or cement. Sun-drying, as opposed to kiln-firing, further limits the structural performance of shale-based bricks, as the absence of vitrification or sintering processes precludes the development of strong interparticle bonds, rendering the bricks susceptible to erosion, freeze-thaw cycles, and mechanical breakdown. Alternative uses for spoil shale in land management and construction include its application as aggregate in road base, fill material for landscaping and reclamation, or as a substrate for ecological restoration, provided that potential issues such as acid mine drainage, heavy metal leaching, and compaction are assessed and mitigated through geochemical and geotechnical evaluation."
"I was wondering if we could possibly reduce the severity of, or steer a hurricane by changing albedo (e.g. dying the part ocean with a temporary light colored dye)? My thought would be to put this dye well in front of the path of a hurricane, with enough time to reflect the sunlight back off the ocean and cool the ocean surface.

For water to lose heat time is required. By changing the albedo of the ocean

However, the scale of intervention required to meaningfully lower SSTs over the vast swaths of ocean traversed by hurricanes is immense, given the high thermal inertia of seawater and the rapid, large-scale energy exchanges involved in tropical cyclone dynamics, making localized or even regional albedo modification logistically and energetically prohibitive with current technology. The environmental ramifications of introducing dyes, films, or particulates—such as disruption of marine photosynthesis, alteration of gas exchange (notably oxygen and carbon dioxide), and potential toxicity or ecosystem imbalance—pose significant risks, and the transient nature of such interventions (due to ocean mixing, currents, and precipitation) further limits their efficacy and predictability. Regarding hurricane steering, while hurricanes are influenced by SST gradients and atmospheric steering currents, the magnitude of SST modification achievable by these methods is unlikely to create sufficient thermal gradients to alter a hurricane’s trajectory, as steering is dominated by large-scale synoptic atmospheric patterns rather than mesoscale surface temperature anomalies. Additionally, unintended consequences such as altered precipitation patterns, ecological damage, or even localized intensification due to complex feedbacks cannot be ruled out, and the ethical, legal, and geopolitical implications of geoengineering interventions in international waters remain unresolved.","The concept of mitigating hurricane intensity or altering its trajectory by modifying oceanic albedo—such as through the application of light-colored dyes, reflective surface films, or aerosolized particulates—centers on the fundamental thermodynamic relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and tropical cyclone energetics, as hurricanes derive their latent heat energy from warm ocean surfaces typically above 26.5°C. Theoretically, increasing the ocean’s albedo in the projected path of a hurricane could reduce the net shortwave solar radiation absorbed by the upper ocean, thereby lowering SST and potentially diminishing the enthalpy flux available to the storm, which could in turn reduce maximum potential intensity (MPI) as described by Emanuel’s theory. However, the spatial and temporal scales required to effect a meaningful SST reduction—given the vastness of the oceanic mixed layer, the high thermal inertia of seawater, and the rapid translation speed of hurricanes—render such interventions logistically and energetically prohibitive, with current modeling suggesting that only large-scale, persistent, and highly reflective modifications could produce even marginal cooling. Furthermore, the steering of hurricanes is governed primarily by large-scale atmospheric flow patterns (e.g., subtropical ridges, troughs, and beta drift) rather than localized SST anomalies, making it highly improbable that artificially cooled ocean patches could exert sufficient influence on storm track, especially given the self-organizing nature of hurricane heat uptake and the storm’s ability to expand its wind field to access alternative heat sources. Environmental ramifications of such geoengineering approaches—including disruption of marine primary productivity, alteration of gas exchange processes (e.g., CO₂ and O₂ fluxes), and potential ecotoxicological effects of dyes or films—pose significant risks, and unintended consequences such as altered ocean stratification or even enhanced storm intensity via baroclinic processes cannot be ruled out without comprehensive, high-resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling and rigorous environmental impact assessments."

Approximately 4.6 billion years ago, gravitational collapse within a molecular cloud led to the formation of a rotating protoplanetary disk, with the proto-Sun at its center and the accretion of dust and gas forming planetesimals and protoplanets through the process of planetary accretion. The Earth formed via the gradual coalescence of these planetesimals, experiencing differentiation as heavier elements like iron and nickel sank to form the core, while lighter silicates formed the mantle and crust, a process influenced by repeated impacts, including the hypothesized giant impact event that led to the formation of the Moon. The presence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in Earth and other terrestrial planets is direct evidence of prior supernova nucleosynthesis, confirming that the Solar System’s material was seeded by one or more supernovae before the Sun’s formation. Thus, while Earth did not form directly from a single supernova, the explosion of a massive star played a critical role in providing the necessary heavy elements and triggering the collapse of the solar nebula, ultimately leading to the formation of the Earth and the rest of the Solar System.","The formation of Earth is rooted in the broader context of Solar System formation, which commenced approximately 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a dense region within a molecular cloud, known as the solar nebula, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and trace heavier elements synthesized in previous generations of stars and dispersed by supernova nucleosynthesis. The hypothesis that a massive progenitor star underwent a core-collapse supernova is substantiated by isotopic anomalies, such as the presence of short-lived radionuclides (e.g., ^26Al and ^60Fe) in primitive meteorites, indicating injection of freshly synthesized stellar material into the protosolar nebula, thereby catalyzing its collapse and subsequent accretion processes. As the nebula contracted, conservation of angular momentum led to the formation of a rotating protoplanetary disk, within which dust grains coalesced via electrostatic and collisional aggregation into planetesimals, which further accreted through gravitational interactions and oligarchic growth into planetary embryos. The proto-Earth emerged through a series of high-energy collisions and mergers, including the hypothesized giant impact event with a Mars-sized body (Theia), which is widely accepted as the origin of the Moon and contributed to the differentiation and volatile inventory of the early Earth. Thus, Earth's genesis is a consequence of stellar evolution, nebular dynamics, and planetary accretion processes, with the supernova event serving as a critical trigger and source of heavy elements essential for terrestrial planet formation."

Arid regions, defined by an aridity index (the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) below 0.20, include major deserts such as the Sahara, Arabian, Gobi, and parts of the Australian Outback, collectively covering about 46 million square kilometers. These arid zones are primarily distributed between latitudes 15° and 35° in both hemispheres, influenced by subtropical high-pressure systems, continentality, and rain shadow effects. The prevalence of arid climates has significant implications for biodiversity, soil degradation, water scarcity, and human habitation, making them focal points for research in climatology, ecology, and sustainable land management. Current estimates indicate that arid and semi-arid lands together constitute roughly one-third of the terrestrial surface, but only about 12% of the planet’s total surface area, considering that oceans cover approximately 71% of Earth.","Arid regions, as defined by the Köppen climate classification and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) aridity index (precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio less than 0.20), encompass approximately 12% of Earth's terrestrial surface, with broader definitions of drylands—including semi-arid and dry subhumid zones—expanding this figure to nearly 41%. The spatial distribution of arid climates is primarily governed by global atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the descending limbs of the Hadley cells, which create persistent high-pressure zones and minimal precipitation in subtropical latitudes, exemplified by the Sahara, Arabian, and Australian deserts. These arid zones are characterized by low annual precipitation, high potential evapotranspiration, sparse vegetation cover, and significant diurnal temperature variability, resulting in unique geomorphological processes such as aeolian erosion, salt weathering, and the formation of desert pavements and playas. Remote sensing data, global climate models, and aridity indices are routinely employed to delineate and monitor the extent of arid lands, with contemporary assessments indicating that anthropogenic climate change and land-use practices may be contributing to the expansion of arid and semi-arid zones, a phenomenon known as desertification. The quantification and mapping of arid regions are critical for understanding global biogeochemical cycles, water resource management, ecosystem services, and the vulnerability of human populations to climate variability and land degradation."

The question doesn't really make sense.

The Richter and other [ seismic magnitude scales
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_magnitude_scales) are measures of how
much energy was released by an earthquake or how much work it did. An
earthquake doesn't ""feel like"" any particular magnitude at any given point;
rather, magnitude is an inherent attribute of the earthquake itself.

""Feels like"" is measured on [ seismic intensity scales
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_intensity_scales) such as the Mercalli
scale. These measure the peak acceleration or velocity at a given point, or
the damage done by the earthquake. Intensity is influenced by many things,
such as the depth of the earthquake, the distance to the ruptured section of
the fault, and the local surface material.

Translating between the two is difficult, and requires knowing the detailed
geology of the area involved. The picture below is a USGS map of two
earthquakes of comparable magnitude, the [ 1994 Northridge earthquake

earthquake on the [ New Madrid Seismic Zone

In both cases, the outer zone is an intensity of Mercalli II or above, while
the inner zone is an intensity of Mercalli VI or above.

Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and
Missouri.](https://i.sstatic.net/yP3vh.jpg) ](https://i.sstatic.net/yP3vh.jpg)","The perceived intensity of an earthquake at a distance from its epicenter is not directly equivalent to the earthquake’s moment magnitude (Mw), which quantifies the total energy released at the source, but is instead described by the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which reflects local shaking and damage. Seismic wave attenuation, governed by regional crustal properties and geometric spreading, causes the amplitude of seismic waves to decrease with distance, and empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) or attenuation relationships are used to estimate the expected peak ground acceleration (PGA) or intensity at a given distance from the epicenter. For example, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake at a distance of 1370 km would typically be felt as a weak to light shaking (MMI II–IV), depending on local geology, depth of the earthquake, and whether the path is continental or oceanic, with the intensity roughly corresponding to what would be experienced near the epicenter of a much smaller earthquake, such as magnitude 3–4. Online calculators and scientific literature, such as the USGS ShakeMap or the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) attenuation relationships, can provide rough estimates of felt intensity at various distances, but precise calculation requires input of magnitude, depth, distance, and regional attenuation parameters. Ultimately, while a direct formula for converting magnitude and distance to perceived intensity exists in the form of empirical attenuation equations, the result is always an approximation due to the complex interplay of seismic source characteristics, propagation path, and site effects.","The perceived intensity of seismic shaking at a distance from an earthquake’s epicenter is quantified by the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which differs fundamentally from the moment magnitude (Mw) or Richter magnitude (ML), as intensity is a function of not only earthquake magnitude but also hypocentral distance, focal depth, local geology, and attenuation properties of the crust. Seismologists employ ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) or intensity attenuation relationships, such as the empirical formula I = a + bM – c log10(R) – dR, where I is intensity, M is magnitude, R is hypocentral distance (in km), and a, b, c, d are regionally calibrated coefficients, to estimate felt intensity at a given distance; for example, a magnitude 8 earthquake at 1370 km distance would typically be felt as a weak to light shaking (MMI II–IV), roughly corresponding to the perceptual equivalent of a local magnitude 3–4 event. Online tools like the USGS “Did You Feel It?” calculator or ShakeMap, as well as published attenuation tables (e.g., Wald et al., 1999), facilitate such conversions, though results are inherently approximate due to site effects, directivity, and basin amplification. The logarithmic decay of seismic wave amplitude with distance, compounded by anelastic attenuation and geometric spreading, means that the felt intensity decreases rapidly with increasing distance, and at teleseismic ranges (hundreds to thousands of kilometers), surface waves may still be perceptible but rarely cause damage. It is not possible to directly “convert” a distant magnitude 8 event to a local magnitude at a remote site, as magnitude is an intrinsic property of the earthquake’s energy release, whereas intensity is a local, subjective measure of ground shaking, but attenuation models provide a robust framework for estimating expected shaking levels. Ultimately, while rough estimation is feasible using attenuation relationships, precise calculation requires region-specific GMPEs and consideration of local site amplification, making any such equivalence an approximation rather than a strict conversion."
"For some time now, I've noticed that mountains in southeast Asia seem to be unusually ""jagged"" with steep surfaces.

Another interesting feature is that as karst caves collapse, the cavity fills
up with material from the ceiling and the cavity can continue to migrate
upwards through the stratigraphy. Those karsts can be important channels for
groundwater or petroleum. Sometimes the collapse material is more resistant to
erosion than the surrounding rocks, and we get pinnacles of karst breccia left
behind.","The unusually jagged and steep morphology of mountains in Southeast Asia, such as those in northern Vietnam, southern China (e.g., Guangxi), and Thailand, is primarily attributed to the prevalence of karst topography, which develops in regions underlain by thick, highly fractured limestone bedrock subjected to intense chemical weathering and dissolution in warm, humid tropical climates, resulting in dramatic tower karst (fenglin) and cone karst (fengcong) landforms. Unlike glacially carved arêtes and horns found in high-latitude or alpine environments, Southeast Asian karst landscapes are shaped by the aggressive dissolution of carbonate rocks by slightly acidic rainwater and groundwater, leading to the formation of steep-sided limestone pinnacles, cliffs, and residual hills, often with deep sinkholes and subterranean drainage systems. Tectonic uplift associated with the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, as well as regional faulting and folding, has exposed these carbonate sequences to surface processes, enhancing vertical relief and promoting rapid denudation. The lack of significant glacial modification in these low-latitude regions means that fluvial and chemical weathering dominate, preserving sharp ridges and escarpments rather than smoothing them, while high rates of precipitation and biological activity further accelerate karstification and slope retreat. Consequently, the distinctively jagged appearance of Southeast Asian mountains is a product of the interplay between tectonic uplift, lithological composition (limestone dominance), tropical climate-driven karst processes, and minimal glacial erosion, distinguishing them from both tectonic orogenies with more subdued profiles and glacially sculpted mountain ranges.","The pronounced jaggedness and steep relief of mountains in Southeast Asia, such as those in northern Vietnam, Laos, and southern China (notably the karst landscapes of Guangxi and Ha Long Bay), primarily result from the interplay of active tectonic uplift, intense chemical weathering in a humid tropical climate, and the prevalence of carbonate lithologies, especially thick-bedded limestone. Unlike glacially sculpted terrains, where cirques, arêtes, and horns are carved by ice, Southeast Asian mountains owe their sharp morphology to rapid exhumation rates driven by ongoing convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates, which generates high rates of orogenic uplift and faulting, exposing fresh rock to surface processes. The region's monsoonal precipitation and warm temperatures accelerate dissolutional weathering (karstification), producing tower karst, pinnacles, and steep-sided ridges as acidic rainwater percolates through fractures, preferentially dissolving carbonate bedrock and leaving behind residual, highly dissected landforms. The lack of significant glaciation during the Quaternary in these latitudes means that fluvial and chemical denudation, rather than glacial abrasion, dominate landscape evolution, maintaining sharp topographic gradients and inhibiting the development of broad, rounded summits typical of older, tectonically quiescent or glaciated ranges. Consequently, the distinctive jaggedness of Southeast Asian mountains reflects a dynamic equilibrium between rapid tectonic uplift, aggressive tropical karstification, and minimal glacial modification, resulting in a geomorphology that is both youthful and highly dissected compared to more temperate or ancient orogenic belts."

We call this the [ airborne fraction

suggests, it's normally expressed as a fraction rather than a percentage.

[ Raupach et al (2014) ](https://www.biogeosciences.net/11/3453/2014/) is an
(open access) example of it being used in the literature, and in that paper
they quote a long-term 1959 to 2012 value of 0.44, so in the same ball-park as

over single years, as in your example, to look at the trends and variability.

The airborne fraction quantifies the proportion of emitted CO2 that is not absorbed by carbon sinks and thus accumulates in the atmosphere, contributing to the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In the context of your calculation, with an annual emission of 4.6 ppm and an observed atmospheric increase of 2 ppm, the airborne fraction is approximately 40%, indicating that about 60% of emitted CO2 is sequestered by natural sinks. The airborne fraction is a critical parameter in carbon cycle science, climate modeling, and policy analysis, as it reflects the efficiency of the Earth's biosphere and oceans in mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Variations in the airborne fraction over time can signal changes in sink strength due to climate feedbacks, land use change, or ocean chemistry, making it a key metric for understanding and predicting the trajectory of atmospheric CO2 and climate change.","The technical term for the percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions that remains in the atmosphere after accounting for natural sinks is the ""airborne fraction"" of CO2.

This metric is critical in carbon cycle studies, as it encapsulates the dynamic equilibrium between sources (fossil fuel combustion, land-use change) and sinks (photosynthetic assimilation, oceanic dissolution), reflecting the efficacy of Earth's natural carbon sequestration processes. The airborne fraction is typically expressed as a ratio or percentage, calculated by dividing the observed annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration by the total anthropogenic emissions for that year, as exemplified by the 2/4.6 (~40%) value in the scenario provided.

The DFT decomposes the time series into sinusoidal components, allowing direct extraction of the amplitude A(z, y, x) and phase angle ϕ(z, y, x) at the frequency corresponding to a 12-month period (the first harmonic, or k=1 for annual cycle if time steps are monthly), where the amplitude is computed as the modulus of the complex Fourier coefficient and the phase as its argument (angle).

The methodology involves transforming the entire time series at each grid cell, isolating the Fourier coefficients corresponding to the 12-month (annual) frequency, where the real and imaginary parts of the complex Fourier coefficient at this frequency encode both the amplitude (A = sqrt(Re² + Im²)) and the phase angle (ϕ = arctan2(-Im, Re)), with the negative sign in the imaginary component arising from the convention of the cosine representation. It is critical to use the full time series rather than just the climatological monthly means, as this preserves interannual variability and avoids aliasing, ensuring that the extracted annual harmonic reflects both the mean seasonal cycle and its modulation over the analysis period. The phase angle ϕ(z,y,x) directly indicates the timing (in months) of the annual maximum, which can be converted from radians to calendar months by scaling with the period (P = 12 months), thus providing spatially explicit information on the seasonal progression of temperature and salinity maxima. This approach leverages the orthogonality of Fourier basis functions, allowing unambiguous separation of the annual harmonic from higher-order (semiannual, interannual) and aperiodic variability, and is standard in oceanographic and climatological time series analysis for quantifying the spatial structure and timing of the seasonal cycle in hydrographic fields."

Oxygen production efficiency is fundamentally governed by net photosynthetic rate, which is influenced by stomatal conductance, chlorophyll concentration, Rubisco activity, and photorespiratory losses, as well as environmental factors like light intensity, CO₂ availability, and water status. Plants with high leaf-to-stem ratios and minimal non-photosynthetic tissue allocate more resources to chloroplast-rich mesophyll, maximizing gross primary productivity (GPP) and net oxygen evolution per unit dry mass. In terrestrial ecosystems, annuals and herbaceous perennials with rapid turnover and high relative growth rates (RGR) outperform woody species in oxygen output per kilogram, while in aquatic systems, submerged and floating plants with direct CO₂ and light access exhibit exceptional photosynthetic efficiency.

In a nutshell, you're a little bit right. The Air pressure is essentially
Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules hitting our bodies, but that's true with and
without wind.

wind is more easily explained from the macro-scale not the micro-scale. It's
not molecular behavior but governed by forces like high and low pressure
systems and weather, or, fans if you're indoors.

molecules is pretty consistent like 3d billiard balls, though velocity of the

Wind is, in a nutshell, the entire box moving, not individual particles
changing direction, but it could probably be looked at either way.

If all the air molecules, by some strange coincidence, all moved in the same
direction 2 things would happen. One, the air would get very cold as
temperature is essentially agitated molecules moving or vibrating against each
other, and two, the wind speed would be over 1000 kph. Roughly the speed of
sound. Fortunately this kind of thing is so statistically improbable it
essentially never happens.","Wind is the bulk movement of air, which is a mixture of gases—primarily nitrogen (~78% by volume), oxygen (~21%), and trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases—driven by pressure gradients resulting from differential solar heating and the Coriolis effect. When wind is experienced, it is indeed predominantly nitrogen and oxygen molecules whose collective translational motion exhibits a net vector in a specific direction, superimposed on their random thermal motion as described by the kinetic theory of gases. The sensation of wind on the skin is due to the momentum transfer from these moving air molecules, with nitrogen molecules being the most numerous contributors due to their abundance, although oxygen and other minor constituents also participate. The macroscopic flow of wind is governed by fluid dynamics principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations, and is influenced by atmospheric pressure differences, temperature gradients, and topographical features. Thus, wind can be accurately described as the coordinated, directional movement of air molecules—mainly nitrogen—whose aggregate motion constitutes the phenomenon we perceive as wind.","Wind is the bulk movement of atmospheric air masses, primarily composed of diatomic nitrogen (N₂, approximately 78% by volume) and oxygen (O₂, about 21%), with trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases; thus, when wind is experienced, it is indeed predominantly nitrogen and oxygen molecules whose net translational motion constitutes the macroscopic flow of air. The sensation of wind arises from the collective kinetic energy and momentum transfer of these gas molecules, which, under the influence of pressure gradients generated by differential solar heating, Coriolis force, and frictional interactions with the Earth's surface, move coherently in a preferred direction rather than exhibiting purely random Brownian motion. While nitrogen molecules numerically dominate, the physical properties of wind—such as density, viscosity, and thermal capacity—are emergent from the combined behavior of all atmospheric constituents, not solely nitrogen, and the dynamic processes governing wind include advection, turbulence, and vertical mixing within the planetary boundary layer. The molecular composition of air ensures that the flux of momentum and energy in wind is a function of the entire atmospheric mixture, and not exclusively nitrogen, although nitrogen's abundance means it contributes most to the mass and momentum transfer. Therefore, wind is not simply nitrogen particles moving in one direction, but rather the organized, large-scale movement of the entire atmospheric mixture, with nitrogen as the principal but not exclusive component, governed by complex atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamic principles."
"My understanding of climate change is that a large increase in human-caused CO2 emissions is likely to lead to large change in the Earth's climate through a global warming effect. Scientific consensus appears to me to be that if we make similarly large reductions in CO2 emissions, we can reduce the magnitude of the consequent warming.

I also understand the climate to have many non-linear mechanisms whereby the link between emission and warming isn't at all straightforward - and so we can only talk about broad averages and so forth, rather than make specific weather predictions.

So is it always true that a reduction in emissions will - on average - cause a reduction in the global warming effect, however small? Or does the existence of tipping points or any other factor mean that only large reductions can make a difference now and any lesser reduction will be pointless?

My intuition says that smaller cuts in emissions should still be preferred to no cuts at all, as I imagine that they would reduce the peak warming and/or delay the peak for longer and/or reduce the eventual recovery time.

Yes, because carbon emissions [ are like a budget

So, just like a household or business budget, small (but persistent)
reductions in spending/emissions do make a difference in the long run.","Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the primary driver of recent global warming, with the radiative forcing effect of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations leading to higher global mean surface temperatures, as established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the scientific consensus. The relationship between emissions and warming is approximately linear for cumulative CO2, meaning that each increment of emissions contributes proportionally to additional warming, though the climate system exhibits non-linearities and potential tipping points—such as ice sheet collapse, permafrost thaw, and changes in ocean circulation—that could amplify or accelerate warming beyond linear expectations. Even small reductions in emissions result in lower cumulative CO2, thereby reducing the magnitude of eventual warming, delaying the approach to critical thresholds, and lessening the risk of triggering irreversible climate feedbacks, although the absolute impact scales with the size of the reduction. The concept of committed warming, or ""warming in the pipeline,"" means that some temperature increase is inevitable due to past emissions and thermal inertia in the climate system, but further emissions reductions can still limit additional warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, extreme weather, and ecosystem disruption. Thus, while only large-scale, rapid decarbonization can stabilize global temperatures near the Paris Agreement targets, incremental emissions reductions remain valuable by mitigating cumulative impacts, reducing the likelihood of crossing tipping points, and improving the prospects for future climate recovery.","Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the principal driver of enhanced radiative forcing, leading to global mean surface temperature increases via the greenhouse effect, as established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and supported by robust climate modeling and paleoclimate evidence. The relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global warming is approximately linear over relevant policy timescales, encapsulated by the concept of the Transient Climate Response to cumulative CO2 Emissions (TCRE), although non-linear feedbacks such as ice-albedo feedback, permafrost carbon release, and changes in oceanic carbon uptake introduce uncertainty and the potential for abrupt, irreversible shifts known as climate tipping points. Even incremental reductions in emissions decrease the rate of atmospheric CO2 accumulation, thereby lowering the magnitude and rate of warming, delaying the approach to critical thresholds, and reducing the risk of crossing tipping points that could trigger self-reinforcing warming processes. While the existence of non-linearities and thresholds means that some climate system responses may be discontinuous or exhibit hysteresis, the aggregate effect of emissions reductions—regardless of scale—remains beneficial in terms of limiting peak warming, reducing climate damages, and enhancing the probability of eventual climate stabilization. Thus, smaller emissions cuts, though insufficient alone to achieve ambitious temperature targets (such as those articulated in the Paris Agreement), are scientifically justified as they yield quantifiable mitigation of warming and its associated impacts, supporting the principle of cumulative emissions control as a central tenet of climate policy and Earth system management."

The order  $m$  is the zonal wave number, that is how many waves we count

Spherical harmonics are a set of orthogonal basis functions on the sphere, analogous to Fourier series on the circle, and are not directly related to Lagrange polynomials but rather to associated Legendre polynomials, which form the angular part of the solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates. The Earth's gravitational potential is commonly expressed as a series expansion in spherical harmonics, with the coefficients (Stokes coefficients) determined from satellite and terrestrial gravity data, and the truncation at a certain degree and order (such as 2159 for EGM2008) defines the spatial resolution and fidelity of the gravity model, with higher degrees and orders capturing smaller-scale features. The terms ""complete to degree and order N"" means that all spherical harmonic terms up to degree N and order N are included, enabling the model to resolve features down to approximately 9 km spatial wavelength for EGM2008, as the spatial resolution is inversely proportional to the maximum degree. In gravity gradient-based autonomous navigation, the accuracy and resolution of the gravitational model, as determined by its maximum degree and order, directly impact the precision of position estimation, since the gravity gradients are sensitive to high-frequency variations in the gravitational field encoded by the higher-degree and -order terms.","In the context of gravitational models and spherical harmonics, particularly as applied in geodesy and autonomous navigation using gravity gradients, the terms ""degree"" and ""order"" refer to the indices (n, m) in the spherical harmonic expansion of the Earth's gravitational potential, where the degree (n) denotes the level of latitude-dependent detail and the order (m) represents the longitudinal variation, with both indices controlling the spatial resolution and complexity of the gravity field representation. Spherical harmonics are a set of orthogonal basis functions defined on the sphere, analogous to Fourier series for periodic functions, and are not directly related to Lagrange polynomials, which are used for polynomial interpolation rather than global potential field modeling. The Earth's gravitational potential V(r, θ, φ) is typically expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics, with coefficients (Cnm, Snm) encoding the mass distribution anomalies, and the truncation at a specific maximum degree and order (e.g., 2159 for EGM2008) determines the finest spatial features resolvable by the model, with higher degrees capturing smaller-scale variations.

essential in the formation of sedimentary rocks, on Earth anyway.

###  Footnote

You were right to be skeptical, by the way; the video is introductory material
apparently intended for grade school audience, so you can't treat it like a
textbook. And you can't even take a textbook as 'truth', especially when it
comes to slippery things like definitions. Sometimes generalizations and
simplifications help, sometimes they don't.","Sedimentary rock formation, or lithification, primarily involves the deposition, compaction, and cementation of sediments, which are typically transported and deposited by agents such as water, wind, or ice; however, the vast majority of sedimentary rocks form in aqueous environments due to water’s superior ability to transport, sort, and deposit mineral and organic particles, as well as facilitate chemical precipitation and diagenetic processes. While water is the dominant medium for sediment accumulation—leading to classic environments like river deltas, lakes, and ocean basins—sedimentary rocks can also originate from aeolian (wind-blown) or glacial (ice-transported) sediments, though these are less common and often eventually interact with water during burial and lithification. The essential processes of compaction and cementation, which transform loose sediment into solid rock, require the presence of mineral-rich fluids, most often groundwater, to precipitate cements such as calcite, quartz, or iron oxides between sediment grains. Although any material buried under sufficient pressure and temperature could undergo diagenesis, the term ""sedimentary rock"" is reserved for rocks formed from pre-existing particles (clasts) or chemical precipitates, distinguishing them from igneous and metamorphic rocks, which form from melting or recrystallization, respectively. Therefore, while the video’s assertion that sedimentary rock formation only occurs in water is an oversimplification, it reflects the predominant role of aquatic environments in sedimentary processes, though non-aqueous mechanisms and subsequent water-mediated diagenesis are also significant in the rock cycle.","Sedimentary rock formation is fundamentally governed by the processes of weathering, erosion, transport, deposition, burial, compaction, and lithification, with water acting as the principal medium for sediment transport and deposition in most environments, including fluvial, lacustrine, deltaic, and marine settings; however, sedimentary rocks can also form in terrestrial environments where aeolian (wind-driven) or glacial processes dominate, such as in desert dune fields or glacial outwash plains, indicating that aqueous environments are not an exclusive prerequisite. The transformation of unconsolidated sediment into sedimentary rock, termed diagenesis, involves compaction under overburden pressure and cementation by minerals precipitated from pore fluids, processes that can occur wherever sufficient burial and geochemical conditions exist, regardless of the original depositional medium. While the majority of sedimentary rocks—such as sandstones, shales, and limestones—originate from sediments deposited in aquatic settings due to the efficiency of water in transporting and sorting particles, significant lithified deposits like eolian sandstones (e.g., the Navajo Sandstone) and tillites (lithified glacial till) demonstrate that sedimentary rock formation is not restricted to subaqueous environments. The essential criterion for sedimentary rock genesis is the accumulation of particulate material, followed by burial and diagenetic alteration, rather than the exclusive involvement of water, although aqueous processes are dominant in the sedimentary rock record due to their prevalence and effectiveness. Therefore, the assertion that sedimentary rocks can only form in water is an oversimplification, as sedimentary lithification can result from a variety of depositional and post-depositional processes in both aquatic and non-aquatic environments, contingent on the interplay of sediment supply, depositional energy, burial depth, and geochemical milieu."

Deserts have existed since at least the Permian period (299-251 million years
ago) when the world's continents had combined into the Pangaea supercontinent.
Stretching from pole to pole, this land mass was large enough that portions of
its interior received little or no precipitation, [ according the University
of California Museum of Paleontology
](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permian.php) .

Pangaea broke into smaller land masses which were moved across the surface by
tectonic forces, a process that both changed global climate patterns and the
climate those continents were exposed to. As a result, current desert regimes
date back to no more than 65.5 million years, according to [ this Encyclopedia

Which would put the oldest of ""modern"" desert somewhere in the region of what
later became North Africa or South Asia.","The formation of the first non-polar, arid deserts—characterized by low precipitation, high evaporation rates, and sparse vegetation—can be traced to the late Paleozoic Era, particularly the Permian Period (approximately 299–252 million years ago), when the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea led to vast continental interiors experiencing extreme aridity due to their distance from oceanic moisture sources. Geological and sedimentological evidence, such as extensive eolian (wind-blown) sandstone deposits and evaporite layers, indicates that deserts have existed for at least 300 million years, with the Permian erg systems (e.g., the Rotliegend of Europe and the Coconino Sandstone of North America) representing some of the earliest large-scale arid environments. The fundamental drivers of ancient desert formation include continental configuration, global climate regimes, atmospheric circulation patterns (such as the Hadley cell), and orographic barriers, all of which influence precipitation distribution and evaporation rates. The first major non-icy desert is often considered to be the Permian erg systems, though smaller-scale arid regions may have existed earlier during the late Carboniferous as a result of glacial-interglacial cycles and the rain shadow effect. Over geological time, deserts have waxed and waned in response to plate tectonics, sea level changes, and long-term climate fluctuations, but the existence of ancient eolian sandstones and evaporites demonstrates that arid, dry deserts have been a persistent feature of Earth's terrestrial environments since at least the late Paleozoic.","The emergence of the first non-polar, arid desert environments on Earth is intrinsically linked to the evolution of continental landmasses, atmospheric oxygenation, and the development of climatic zonation, with geological evidence indicating that the earliest true hot deserts—characterized by hyperaridity, low precipitation (typically <250 mm/year), high evaporation rates, and the formation of aeolian (wind-blown) sandstones—likely appeared during the late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic eras, approximately 500–600 million years ago, as evidenced by ancient desert sandstones such as the Neoproterozoic Nama Group in Namibia and the Cambrian-Ordovician erg deposits in North Africa and North America. The persistence of deserts throughout Earth's Phanerozoic history is corroborated by the widespread occurrence of ancient eolianites, cross-bedded quartz arenites, and evaporite deposits, indicating that aridification and the establishment of subtropical high-pressure belts have been recurring features since the assembly of supercontinents such as Gondwana and Pangaea, which facilitated continental interior aridity. The earliest unequivocal non-icy desert is often attributed to the late Precambrian to Cambrian erg systems, with the Nama Group and the Cambrian-Ordovician erg deposits representing some of the oldest preserved examples of hot desert sedimentary environments, predating the formation of iconic Mesozoic deserts such as the Navajo Sandstone. The formation and persistence of deserts are governed by atmospheric circulation patterns, orographic rain shadow effects, continentality, and paleogeographic configurations, with the Hadley Cell-driven subtropical deserts (e.g., the modern Sahara) serving as archetypes for ancient analogs. Thus, deserts in the strict sense of arid, non-polar environments have existed for at least half a billion years, with the Nama Group and Cambrian-Ordovician ergs representing the earliest known examples, and their formation is intimately tied to the interplay of tectonics, paleoclimate, and atmospheric dynamics throughout Earth's history."
"Some days I can smell bad smelling exhaust 50 meters or more away from the bus stop. I think the air is usually moist those days.

You can see [ this post
](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13391/where-do-bad-smells-
eventually-go/13392#13392) for a more detailed discussion, but the typical
answer to your question is air stagnation. When the atmosphere is stable,
there is little mixing, and the air can stagnate. Typically this coincides
with low wind speeds and a low boundary layer. The boundary layer holds air
near the surface like a blanket. The boundary layer collapses overnight,
becoming shallow, and grows when the sun heats the surface of the Earth. So,
in the morning, the shallow boundary layer allows less vertical mixing to
occur.

You might be noticing that on cloudy days, when clouds are low, there is
little wind and no solar heating. Air pollution has no place to go, so it
sticks around.

Another aspect is that vehicles emit more emissions under cold-start
conditions. This is because vehicles get cold overnight and take a while to
get up to normal temperature when they startup in the morning. The cold
vehicle will have a low combustion efficiency and catalytic converters won't
work as well.","Exhaust gases, primarily composed of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter, can linger longer near the ground under conditions of high relative humidity and low atmospheric dispersion, as moist air can suppress vertical mixing and enhance the solubility and persistence of certain volatile organic compounds and aerosols. The phenomenon you describe is likely exacerbated by atmospheric stability, potentially due to a temperature inversion or weak vertical temperature gradient, which traps pollutants near the surface, especially in the presence of high humidity (93%) and low temperatures (4°C), as observed on the morning of March 12. The presence of smog, a mixture of smoke and fog containing suspended particulate matter and chemical pollutants, is more perceptible under these meteorological conditions, as moisture can facilitate the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and fine particulates, intensifying odor and visual haze. The barometric pressure of 978 mbar and moderate wind speed (10 m/s) suggest some potential for horizontal dispersion, but if wind direction is variable or channeled by local topography, pollutant concentrations can remain elevated near ground level and downwind from emission sources such as buses. The data from earth.nullschool.net, indicating surface temperatures around 5°C at 1000 hPa, further support the likelihood of a shallow, moist boundary layer conducive to pollutant accumulation and limited vertical mixing, resulting in the pronounced detection of exhaust odors at considerable distances from the source.","The persistence and perceptibility of exhaust gases, such as those from diesel buses, are influenced by atmospheric conditions including humidity, temperature, wind speed, and boundary layer dynamics; high near-surface relative humidity (93%) and low temperatures (4°C) can suppress vertical mixing by promoting atmospheric stability, especially if a nocturnal or radiation inversion is present, thereby allowing pollutants to accumulate and linger near the ground. Moist air can enhance the olfactory detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust, as water vapor facilitates the dissolution and transport of odorant molecules, while also participating in secondary aerosol and photochemical reactions that may contribute to the formation of smog, particularly under stagnant conditions. The meteorological data—low temperature, high humidity, low barometric pressure (978 mbar), and moderate wind (10 m/s)—suggests a synoptic situation possibly associated with a passing low-pressure system, which can induce variable mixing heights; however, if wind speeds are locally reduced by urban structures or microclimatic effects, pollutant dispersion may still be limited. The presence of smog, defined as a mixture of smoke and fog or photochemical haze, is more likely under conditions of high humidity and pollutant concentration, but the specific odor detected is more directly attributable to primary exhaust constituents rather than secondary smog formation, unless there is significant photochemical activity or particulate matter accumulation. The surface temperature gradient observed in earth.nullschool.net data, with temperatures at 1000 hPa slightly higher than at the surface, may indicate a weak inversion or stable stratification, further inhibiting vertical dispersion and enhancing the persistence of malodorous exhaust plumes at pedestrian level."

I believe what you heard is “subtelluric” where [ telluric

In volcanology, forces driving eruptions are typically described as magmatic, tectonic, or hydrothermal, with subvolcanic processes referring to magma movement, pressure buildup, and volatile exsolution beneath the volcanic edifice, which can lead to explosive eruptions and the ejection of pyroclastic material. The prefix ""sub-"" denotes ""beneath"" or ""below,"" while ""relluric"" does not have a defined meaning, but could be a creative distortion of ""telluric"" (from Latin ""tellus,"" meaning earth), which refers to processes or currents originating within the earth. In the context of a volcanic eruption, the phrase ""subrelluric forces"" could be interpreted as referring to the intense, dynamic geological processes occurring beneath the earth's surface—such as magma chamber pressurization, lithostatic stress, and volatile gas accumulation—that culminate in the violent expulsion of pyroclastic flows, ash, and molten debris. Thus, while ""subrelluric"" is not a standard scientific term, its usage in the song likely serves a poetic or evocative function, alluding to the powerful, hidden subterranean forces responsible for the catastrophic phenomena observed during explosive volcanic events.","The term ""subrelluric"" as encountered in the lyrics of ""Pyroclastic Annihilation"" by Demolition Hammer does not correspond to any recognized or established term within the lexicon of Earth sciences, volcanology, or geology; it appears to be a neologism or a creative linguistic construction, likely intended to evoke the concept of subterranean or subvolcanic forces.

In volcanology, the actual forces responsible for such phenomena are typically described in terms of magmatic overpressure, tectonic stress, and the rapid decompression of volatile-rich magma, which collectively result in the fragmentation of magma and the ejection of pyroclastic material at high velocities. Therefore, ""subrelluric forces"" in this context should be interpreted as a metaphorical reference to the powerful, subsurface geophysical and geochemical processes that culminate in explosive volcanic activity, rather than as a precise scientific term with a defined meaning in Earth science literature."
"In the mainstream media the problem of ocean level rise is presented rather... over-simplistically - ice melts -> more water flows into the oceans -> water level rises -> continents sink.

But it is in reality a complex system, it is not like pouring water in a glass... or a lake that resides on a continental plate.

Both continental and oceanic plates float on top of the mantle as both are lighter and lower density, and both exert weight and compress the mantle.

Therefore, if water is removed from continental plates by means of melting ice, the continental plate gets lighter. And when that water migrates to the ocean, the oceanic plate gets heavier. And since for every action there is equal in force and opposite in direction reaction, it seems logical that the now heavier oceanic plate will actually push the now lighter continental plate up, to some extent compensating for or possibly even reversing the change in ocean level relative to the continental plate.

So, do the estimates account for the dynamic properties of that complex system?","Relative sea level is the sea level measured in relation to the continental crust, affected by changes in both sea level and land movements.

In general, [ Mean Sea Level ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level) means
the 'water level when it is still' (without waves). MSL is averaged over a
determined period of time, such as a month or a year and it is measured
relative to a fixed mark on the land (benchmark).

As MSL is measured relative to land, it can change due to changes in water
volume or due to land movements. That is why we usually refer to it as
'relative sea level'.

Long-term changes of sea level are called ""secular"" changes and include
isostatic changes. The main reason for isostatic changes at a global scale is

Also, [ here

When continental ice sheets melt, mass is transferred from land to ocean, causing glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA): the formerly ice-burdened continental lithosphere undergoes post-glacial rebound (uplift), while ocean basins experience increased loading and subsidence, both modulating relative sea level (RSL) locally and regionally. State-of-the-art sea level projections incorporate GIA models, accounting for viscoelastic mantle flow, crustal flexure, and gravitational-rotational-perturbation effects, as well as self-attraction and loading (SAL) feedbacks, which together produce spatially variable sea level fingerprints rather than uniform global change. These models are constrained by satellite altimetry, tide gauge records, GPS geodesy, and gravimetric data (e.g., GRACE), enabling differentiation between absolute (geocentric) and relative sea level changes, and quantifying the compensatory uplift of continents versus subsidence of oceanic lithosphere. Consequently, contemporary estimates of sea level rise integrate the dynamic feedbacks of mass redistribution, lithospheric flexure, and mantle rheology, ensuring that projections reflect the coupled solid Earth-ocean-cryosphere system rather than a simplistic water-in-a-glass analogy.","The mainstream depiction of sea level rise as a direct consequence of ice melt overlooks the intricate interplay of glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA), eustatic and relative sea level changes, and the viscoelastic response of the Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere to mass redistribution. When terrestrial ice sheets melt, the resultant mass loss from continental crust induces isostatic rebound (post-glacial uplift) due to reduced lithostatic pressure, while the transfer of meltwater to ocean basins increases hydrostatic loading on oceanic lithosphere, causing regional subsidence and complex gravitational, rotational, and deformational feedbacks. Contemporary sea level projections integrate these geodynamic processes using sophisticated models that couple ice mass balance, solid Earth rheology, and ocean mass redistribution, thereby accounting for spatially variable relative sea level changes rather than a uniform global rise. Furthermore, gravitational self-attraction and loading (SAL) effects, wherein the loss of ice mass reduces local gravitational pull and redistributes ocean water away from former ice sheets, are explicitly incorporated in high-resolution sea level fingerprinting analyses. Thus, state-of-the-art estimates of future sea level rise systematically account for the dynamic, non-uniform, and coupled nature of the solid Earth-ocean-cryosphere system, transcending simplistic ""bathtub"" models and reflecting the full complexity of Earth system processes."

I'm not sure of their current status, but I read some papers based on these
models a few years ago:

  * [ Oxford Planetary Unified Model System ](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/geophysical-fluid-dynamics/research/oxford-planetary-unified-model-system) for Venus (OPUS-V), which is based on an old version of the UK Met Office climate model, HadCM3 ( [ paper ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2016.09.001) from 2016). 

  * ROCKE-3D at Nasa GISS, which is based on an old version of the GISS ModelE2‐R climate model ( [ blog article ](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2475/nasa-climate-modeling-suggests-venus-may-have-been-habitable/) and [ paper ](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL069790) from 2016). 

It looks like the introduction of [ Yamamoto et al
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518304846) (2019)
has a more up-to-date summary of the current set of models, and there's quite
a healthy selection from groups around the world.","The atmospheric dynamics of a tidally locked Venus would be governed by extreme longitudinal temperature gradients, with a persistent subsolar thermal low and a permanent nightside cold trap, driving intense day-to-night heat transport via superrotating winds, planetary-scale Hadley circulation, and potentially strong stationary waves, all modulated by the planet’s dense CO₂-rich atmosphere (92 bar surface pressure, 462°C temperature). General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Climate Models (GCMs) capable of simulating such conditions must incorporate non-Earthlike radiative transfer, high-pressure thermodynamics, and cloud microphysics, as implemented in planetary-adapted versions of models like the LMD Generic GCM (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique), ROCKE-3D (NASA GISS), and ExoCAM (NCAR/University of Colorado), which have been used to simulate both present-day Venus and exoplanetary atmospheres under tidally locked configurations. Research groups at LMD (France), NASA GISS (USA), and the University of Exeter (UK) have expertise in adapting these GCMs for high-pressure, high-temperature, and exotic atmospheric compositions, and have published studies on Venus-like and tidally locked exoplanet climates. Key studies include Leconte et al. (2013, 2015) on tidally locked terrestrial planets, Way et al. (2016, 2022) on paleo-Venus and exo-Venus scenarios, and Turbet et al. (2018, 2021) on atmospheric collapse and cloud feedbacks in tidally locked regimes, all utilizing advanced GCMs with Venus-relevant input parameters. Simulations would need to resolve radiative-convective equilibrium, cloud feedbacks (notably sulfuric acid clouds), and atmospheric superrotation under synchronous rotation, with model validation against Venus Express and Akatsuki data where possible. Collaboration with these research groups or access to their published model outputs would enable detailed exploration of atmospheric circulation, surface temperature distribution, and potential habitability or atmospheric stability on a tidally locked Venus.","The atmospheric dynamics of a tidally locked Venus would be governed by extreme radiative forcing asymmetry, with the subsolar point experiencing perpetual insolation, likely generating a persistent thermal low and intense upwelling, while the nightside would be subject to radiative cooling and potential atmospheric collapse if heat redistribution is inefficient. Venus’s current atmospheric state, characterized by a dense CO₂-rich envelope at 92 bar surface pressure and 462°C temperature, exhibits superrotation and a weak diurnal cycle due to its slow retrograde rotation; tidal locking would fundamentally alter the Hadley circulation, zonal jets, and cloud albedo feedbacks, potentially leading to a stark dichotomy between hemispheres. General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Climate Models (GCMs) such as the LMD Venus GCM (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique), ROCKE-3D (NASA GISS), and ExoCAM (NCAR), are capable of simulating high-pressure, high-temperature, and high-opacity atmospheres with radiative transfer schemes adapted for CO₂-dominated compositions, and have been applied to both Venus and exoplanetary atmospheres under tidally locked configurations. Research groups at institutions such as the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (France), NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (USA), and the University of Exeter (UK) have expertise in adapting and running these models for both terrestrial and exoplanetary analogs, including tidally locked scenarios with Venus-like boundary conditions. Simulations of a tidally locked Venus would require parameterizations for cloud microphysics, radiative-convective equilibrium, and surface-atmosphere interactions under extreme greenhouse conditions, and could yield insights into atmospheric heat transport, potential for atmospheric collapse, and the stability of superrotation under synchronous rotation, with implications for both planetary climate evolution and exoplanet habitability studies."
"Researchers who are involved in study of life on Mars are saying that there might be multicellular life present on Mars, today or in the past.

One of the next big missions to Mars, named [ Mars 2020
](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) is planned to depart from Earth to Mars
during late July 2020. This mission involve a [ very capable rover
](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/) , like [ Curiosity
](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/) on steroids.

From the mission site:

> The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable
> conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past
> microbial life itself.

This mean that there is two important objective:

  1. to find **extinct life forms** , such as assuming there was conditions a long time ago permitting lifeforms to exist on Mars, likely 3-3.5 Billion years from now or so, in other words, fossils. Why 3-3.5 Gy ago? This was during Hesperian geological epoch when water was likely a major agent in forming channels lakes and rivers, thus with atmospheric and ground conditions possibly permitting the existence of life back then. 
  2. to find **extant life forms** such as bacteria that are existing presently on Mars surface or near surface. 

One component of the mission is to sample rocks that are likely lifebearing,
analyze and store for a later pickup by a further mission. Lifebearing rocks
in that case may be found as old lake beds, for example iron rich lacustrine
mudstone.

Lacustrine mudstone is obviously originating from depositing fine sediments
over a lake floor, a stable environment through a long time, as shown by
layers like [ this ](https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/msl/pia19074) (pictured by
Curiosity's MastCam in 2014). And iron rich is important as this chemical
arrangement is favoring and helping the preservation of microbial lifeforms.

As can be seen in the picture, the big circle (as a crater) in the center of
the delta is named the Jezero crater and is the target landing site for Mars
2020. This delta was formed due to water flowing in a lake; clay rich
deposited were detected in the area. The crater is exposing deeper (early)
layers in the delta, making this an ideal exploration site to look for extinct
or extinct life.","The hypothesis of extant or extinct multicellular life on Mars is supported by the search for biosignatures such as complex organic molecules, microfossils, isotopic fractionation patterns indicative of biological activity, and morphological structures resembling stromatolites or microbial mats within sedimentary rock formations, particularly in ancient lacustrine or hydrothermal environments like Jezero Crater or Gale Crater. Researchers focus on mineralogical and geochemical markers, including the presence of phyllosilicates, sulfates, and carbonates, which suggest past aqueous environments conducive to life and the potential for preservation of biological material. Investigations employ in situ analyses using instruments such as Raman spectrometers, gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers, and X-ray diffraction tools aboard rovers like Perseverance and Curiosity, as well as remote sensing data from orbiters to identify promising sites for sample collection. The detection of methane plumes, recurring slope lineae, and subsurface brines further motivates the search for extant habitats that could support multicellular extremophiles, while future Mars Sample Return missions aim to enable high-resolution laboratory analyses for definitive identification of biosignatures. The integration of astrobiological, geological, and chemical data, alongside comparative planetology with terrestrial analogs, underpins the multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the plausibility and evidence for multicellular life on Mars.","The hypothesis of extant or extinct multicellular life on Mars necessitates the identification of biosignatures such as complex organic macromolecules, microfossil morphologies, stromatolitic structures, or isotopic fractionation patterns indicative of metabolic processes, particularly within sedimentary lithofacies associated with ancient lacustrine, hydrothermal, or subsurface aquifer environments. Researchers prioritize the detection of preserved extracellular polymeric substances, cell wall remnants, or mineralized biofilms within phyllosilicate-rich strata, evaporitic deposits, or sulfate-bearing outcrops, as these mineralogical contexts enhance biomolecule preservation and are analogous to terrestrial paleoenvironments that fostered early multicellularity. Investigative methodologies integrate in situ Raman and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and high-resolution imaging via rover-based instrumentation, complemented by orbital hyperspectral mapping to target sites exhibiting hydrated minerals, recurring slope lineae, or geomorphological evidence of paleohabitats. The search for redox gradients, chemical disequilibria, and potential metabolic byproducts such as methane, nitrous oxide, or sulfur compounds further constrains the plausibility of extant metabolic networks consistent with multicellular life. Ultimately, sample return missions and advanced astrobiological assays will be essential for unambiguous detection and characterization of putative multicellular biosignatures, leveraging comparative planetology and taphonomic frameworks established through terrestrial analog studies."
"Is there a package for R to plot Schmidt nets, like it is done in geology?

[ Documentation ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RockFab/RockFab.pdf)
.","Schmidt nets, also known as equal-area stereonets, are fundamental tools in structural geology for the graphical representation and analysis of three-dimensional orientation data such as planes and lines, facilitating the visualization of features like bedding, foliation, lineations, and fault planes. While traditional software like Stereonet (by Rick Allmendinger) is widely used for these purposes, the R programming environment offers several packages for stereonet plotting and manipulation, notably the 'RFOC' and 'geosphere' packages, with 'RFOC' providing functions such as net(), focpoint(), and lower() for plotting lower-hemisphere equal-area projections and handling geological orientation data. The 'geostats' and 'struct3d' packages also include stereonet plotting capabilities, supporting the import, transformation, and statistical analysis of orientation datasets within R, thus enabling integration with R’s extensive statistical and graphical toolset. These packages allow users to plot poles, great circles, small circles, and density contours on Schmidt nets, perform kinematic analysis, and conduct advanced statistical treatments such as cluster analysis or bootstrapping of orientation data, which are not as readily available in standalone stereonet software. Utilizing R for Schmidt net plotting enhances reproducibility, automation, and integration with broader geospatial and statistical workflows, making it a powerful alternative for geologists seeking advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities beyond traditional software.","In structural geology, Schmidt nets (equal-area stereonets) are essential graphical tools for visualizing and analyzing the orientation of planar and linear geological features, such as bedding planes, faults, and fold axes, by projecting three-dimensional orientation data onto a two-dimensional plane using an equal-area projection. While traditional standalone software like Stereonet and Stereonet 10 are widely used for these purposes, the R programming environment offers the ""RFOC"" package (part of the ""geosphere"" and ""RSEIS"" ecosystem), which provides robust functions for plotting lower hemisphere equal-area stereonets (Schmidt nets), plotting poles and great circles, and performing orientation data analysis, including calculation of mean vectors, eigenvectors, and statistical tests such as the Fisher distribution. The ""RFOC"" package enables users to import orientation data (strike, dip, rake), visualize them on stereonets, and integrate these plots with advanced statistical workflows native to R, facilitating reproducible geoscientific analyses and seamless integration with other spatial and statistical packages. Additionally, the ""Stereo"" package in R offers similar stereonet plotting capabilities, supporting both equal-area and equal-angle projections, and allows for the manipulation and annotation of geological orientation data, making it suitable for advanced tectonic, structural, and paleomagnetic studies. Utilizing R for Schmidt net plotting empowers geoscientists to automate batch processing, customize graphical outputs, and perform sophisticated statistical analyses, surpassing the limitations of standalone graphical software and fostering open, scriptable, and reproducible research workflows in structural geology and tectonics."

As you state in our question, there a small number of hard rock deposits on
smaller islands that are part of Papua New Guinea.

The only iron ore resource that occurs on the island of New Guinea are
deposits of [ iron sands ](https://mine.onepng.com/2021/11/pngs-orokolo-by-
iron-sand-project.html) . They lie on the [ southern coast of PNG
](https://mayurresources.com/minerals/) , around the coast of the Gulf of
Papua. Currently, the main deposits are at Amazon Bay in the south east and
Orokolo at the top of the gulf.

[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/1NJB1.png)

It appears the iron sands are associated with other mineral sand minerals that
are zircon rich, with some deposits having titanium and others vanadium. The
iron sands are composed of [ magnetite
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite) .","Iron, while globally abundant and a cornerstone of industrial development, is notably scarce in economically viable concentrations within the geological formations of New Guinea, which is dominated by ultramafic and ophiolitic complexes more conducive to the formation of nickel, cobalt, copper, and gold deposits rather than significant banded iron formations or high-grade hematite/magnetite ore bodies. The island's tectonic and metallogenic history, characterized by subduction-related magmatism and hydrothermal activity, has favored the emplacement of porphyry copper-gold systems and lateritic nickel-cobalt deposits, with only minor occurrences of iron-bearing minerals such as limonite or goethite, typically as weathering products rather than primary ore. While trace iron may be present in lateritic soils or as accessory minerals within other ore bodies, there is no evidence of large-scale, commercially exploitable iron ore deposits akin to those found in Australia, Brazil, or even neighboring Bougainville, where iron is often associated with copper mineralization. The absence of significant iron mining operations or exploration projects in Papua New Guinea's mining sector, as documented by the Mineral Resources Authority and international geological surveys, further corroborates the lack of economically significant iron resources. Consequently, New Guinea's metallogenic profile is defined by its polymetallic potential in gold, copper, nickel, and cobalt, with iron remaining a geologically minor and economically negligible component.","The apparent paucity of economically significant iron ore deposits in New Guinea, despite the island's complex tectonic setting and metallogenic richness, reflects the specific geologic processes that have dominated its crustal evolution, favoring the formation of porphyry copper-gold, epithermal gold, lateritic nickel, and cobalt deposits rather than large-scale banded iron formations (BIFs) or high-grade hematite-magnetite ore bodies. The island's geodynamic history, characterized by subduction, arc magmatism, and accretionary processes, has not produced the extensive Precambrian sedimentary basins or stable cratonic environments typically associated with major iron ore provinces such as those found in Western Australia, Brazil, or West Africa. While iron is geochemically ubiquitous and present in trace to minor concentrations within mafic and ultramafic rocks, laterites, and as accessory minerals, the lack of large, concentrated, and economically viable iron ore deposits—defined by sufficient tonnage, grade, and favorable mining logistics—renders New Guinea a region of limited iron mining potential, especially when compared to its globally significant copper-gold and nickel-cobalt resources. Small-scale occurrences of iron-bearing minerals such as limonite, goethite, or magnetite may exist within lateritic profiles or as minor constituents in skarn and hydrothermal systems, but these have not been developed or reported as commercial iron ore operations due to subeconomic grades, limited continuity, and challenging topography and infrastructure. Thus, the absence of major iron ore mining in New Guinea is a function of both geological endowment and economic viability, rather than a complete lack of iron-bearing minerals, and is corroborated by the lack of documentation in regional mineral resource assessments and exploration reports."
